<h3><a name="THE_GLOBE_THEATRE" id="THE_GLOBE_THEATRE">THE GLOBE THEATRE.</a></h3>

<p>The first Globe Theatre, on the Bankside,
Southwark, "the summer theatre of Shakespeare
and his fellows," is believed to have
been built in 1594, partly of materials
removed from the Theatre in Shoreditch,
"the earliest building erected in or near
London purposely for scenic exhibitions."
Outside, the Globe was hexagonal in shape,
and, like all the theatres of that epoch,
was open at the top, excepting the part
immediately over the stage, which was thatched with straw. The
interior of the theatre was circular. The performances took
place by daylight, and while they were going on a flag with the
cross of St. George upon it was unfurled from the roof.
Originally, in place of scenery, the names of the localities
supposed to be represented were inscribed on boards or hangings
for the information of the audience. The sign of the theatre was
a figure of Hercules supporting the globe, beneath which was
written "Totus mundus agit Histrionem."</p>

<p>In 1601, the Globe Theatre was used as a place of meeting by
the conspirators engaged in Essex's rebellion, and next year
Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>, following upon other of his plays, was
here produced for the first time. In subsequent years plays by
Shakespeare, Webster, Ford, and contemporary dramatists were
performed at the Globe, until in 1613 the theatre was burnt to
the ground owing to some lighted paper, thrown from a piece of
ordnance used in the performance, igniting the thatch. The
theatre was rebuilt in the following spring with a tiled roof, and
according to Howes's MS., quoted by Collier in his life of Shakespeare,
"at the great charge of King James and many noblemen
and others." Ben Jonson styled the new theatre "the glory of
the Bank and the fort of the whole parish."</p>

<p>The Globe Theatre was pulled down in 1644 by Sir Matthew
Brand with the view to tenements being erected upon its site, a
portion of which at the present day is occupied by Barclay and
Perkins's brewery.</p>

<h3><a name="JOHN_WEBSTER_AND" id="JOHN_WEBSTER_AND">JOHN WEBSTER AND
CYRIL TOURNEUR.</a></h3>


<p>Nothing is known about the
lives of John Webster and Cyril
Tourneur. We are ignorant
when they were born and when
they died. We possess only
meagre hints of what contemporaries
thought of them.
One allusion to Tourneur survives, which shows
that he was not popular in his lifetime as a
dramatist:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His fame unto that pitch so only raised</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As not to be despised nor too much praised.</span><br />
</p>

<p>A superficial critic speaks of "crabbed Webster,
the playwright, cart-wright," and proceeds, at
some length, to deride his laborious style and
obscurity. Commendatory verses by S. Sheppard,
Th. Middleton, W. Shirley, and John Ford prove,
however, that Webster's tragedies won the suffrage
of the best judges. None such are printed
with Tourneur's plays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster began to write for the stage as early
as 1601. Between that date and 1607 he worked
upon Marston's <i>Malcontent</i>, and is supposed to have
collaborated with Dekker in the <i>History of Sir Th.
Wyatt, Northward Ho,</i> and <i>Westward Ho</i>. Tourneur
began his literary career by a satire called <i>Transformed
Metamorphosis</i>, in 1600, which was followed
in 1609 by a <i>Funeral Poem on the Death of Sir
Francis Vere</i>. Both he and Webster published
Elegies in 1613 upon the death of Prince Henry.</p>

<p>In this year he was employed upon some business
for the Court, as appears from this passage in the
Revels Accounts (ed. Cunningham, p. xliii.):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To Cyrill Turner, upon a warraunte signed by the Lord
Chamberleyne and Mr. Chauncellor, dated at Whitehall, 23rd
December, 1613, for his chardges and paines in carrying l'res
for his Mats. service to Brussells.... X li.</p></blockquote>

<p>The amount of this payment renders it improbable
that Tourneur's mission was of any political
or diplomatical importance.</p>

<p>We do not know when he commenced playwright;
but <i>The Revenger's Tragedy</i> was licensed
in 1607 and printed in the same year. <i>The
Atheist's Tragedy</i> was printed in 1611; it had been
written almost certainly at some earlier period.
Webster's <i>White Devil</i> was printed and probably
produced in 1612; his <i>Duchess of Malfi</i>, produced
perhaps in 1616, was printed in 1623.</p>

<p>It is needful to dwell on the comparison of
these dates, since they give Tourneur the priority
of authorship in a style of tragedy which both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
poets cultivated with marked effect. Not to
class them together as the creators of a singular
type of drama would be uncritical. They elaborated
similar motives, moved in the same atmosphere
of moral gloom, aimed at the like sententious
apophthegms, affected the same brevity
and pungency, handled blank verse and prose on
parallel methods, and owed debts of much the
same kind to Shakespeare. That Webster was
the greater writer, as he certainly possessed a
finer cast of mind, and surveyed a wider sphere
of human nature in his work, will be admitted.
Yet it seems not impossible that he may have
followed Tourneur's lead in the peculiar form and
tone of his two masterpieces.</p>

<p>Speaking broadly, the two best tragedies of
Webster and the two surviving tragedies of Tourneur
constitute a distinct species of the genus
which has been termed Tragedy of Blood.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It
was Kyd, in his double drama called <i>The Spanish
Tragedy</i>, who first gave definite form to this type.
Those two plays exhibit the main ingredients of
the Tragedy of Blood&mdash;a romantic story of crime
and suffering, a violent oppressor, a wronged man
bent upon the execution of some subtle vengeance,
a ghost or two, a notorious villain working as the
tyrant's instrument, and a whole crop of murders,
deaths, and suicides to end the action. What
use Shakespeare made of the type, and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
he glorified it in <i>Hamlet</i>, is well known. Both
Tourneur and Webster, writing after Shakespeare,
had of necessity felt his influence, and their
handling of the species was modified by that of
their great master. Yet they reverted in many
important particulars from the Shakespearean
method to Kyd's. The use they both made of
the villain, a personage which Shakespeare discarded,
might be cited as distinctive. Kyd
described the villain in the character of his
Lazarrotto thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I have a lad in pickle of this stamp,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A melancholy, discontented courtier,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whose famished jaws look like the chap of death;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon whose eyebrow hangs damnation;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whose hands are washed in rape and murders bold;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Him with a golden bait will I allure,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For courtiers will do anything for gold.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The outlines sketched by Kyd were filled in
with touches of diseased perversity and crippled
nobleness by Tourneur in his Vendice, and were
converted into full-length portraits of impressive
sombreness by Webster in his Flamineo and
Bosola.</p>

<p>When we compare Tourneur with Webster as
artists in the Tragedy of Blood, the former is seen
at once to stand upon a lower level. His
workmanship was rougher and less equal; his
insight into nature less humane, though hardly
less incisive; his moral tone muddier and more
venomous; his draughtsmanship spasmodic and
uncertain. Tourneur seems to have invented his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
own plots; they have the air of being fabricated
after a recipe. This flaw&mdash;an apparent insincerity
in the choice of motives&mdash;corresponds to the more
painful moral flaw which makes his occasional
good work like that of a remorseful and regretful
fallen angel. While we read his plays, the line
of Persius rises to our lips:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Virtutem videant intabescantque relictâ.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Webster, as man and artist, never descends to
Tourneur's level. He selects his two great
subjects from Italian story, deriving thence the
pith and marrow of veracity. These subjects
he treats carefully and conscientiously, according
to his own conception of the dreadful depths in
human nature revealed to us by sixteenth century
Italy. He does not use the vulgar machinery of
revenge and ghosts in order to evolve an action.
In so far as this goes, he may even be said to
have advanced a step beyond <i>Hamlet</i> in the
evolution of the Tragedy of Blood. His dramatic
issues are worked out, without much alteration,
from the matter given in the two Italian tales
he used. Only he claims the right to view human
fates and fortunes with despair, to paint a broad
black background for his figures, to detach them
sharply in sinister or pathetic relief, and to leave
us at the last without a prospect over hopeful
things. "One great Charybdis swallows all,"
said the Greek Simonides; and this motto might
be chosen for the work of Shakespeare's greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
pupil in the art of tragedy. Yet Webster never
fails to touch our hearts, and makes us remember
a riper utterance upon the piteousness of man's
ephemeral existence:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sunt lacrimæ rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is just this power of blending tenderness and
pity with the exhibition of acute moral anguish
by which Webster is so superior to Tourneur as
a dramatist.</p>

<p>Both playwrights have this point in common,
that their forte lies not in the construction of
plots, or in the creation of characters, so much as
in an acute sense for dramatic situations. Their
plots are involved and stippled in with slender
touches; they lack breadth, and do not rightly
hang together. Their characters, though forcibly
conceived, tend to monotony, and move mechanically.
But when it is needful to develop a
poignant, a passionate, or a delicate situation,
Tourneur and Webster show themselves to be
masters of their art. They find inevitable words,
the right utterance, not indeed always for their
specific personages, but for generic humanity,
under the <i>peine forte et dure</i> of intense emotional
pressure. Webster, being the larger, nobler,
deeper in his touch on nature, offers a greater
variety of situations which reveal the struggles of
the human soul with sin and fate. He is also
better able to sustain these situations at a high
dramatic pitch&mdash;as in the scene of Vittoria before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
her judges, and the scene of the Duchess of
Malfi's assassination. Still Tourneur can display
a few such moments by apocalyptic flashes&mdash;notably
in the scenes where Vendice deals with
his mother and sister.</p>

<p>Both playwrights indulge the late Elizabethan
predilection for conceits. Webster, here as
elsewhere, proves himself the finer artist. He
inserts Vittoria's dream, Antonio's dialogue with
Echo, Bosola's Masque of Madmen, accidentally
and subserviently to action. Tourneur enlarges
needlessly, but with lurid rhetorical effect, upon
the grisly humours suggested by the skull of
Vendice's dead mistress. Using similar materials,
the one asserts his claim to be called the nobler
poet by more steady observance of the Greek
precept "Nothing overmuch." Words to the
same effect might be written about their several
employment of blank verse and prose. Both
follow Shakespeare's distribution of these forms,
while both run verse into prose as Shakespeare
never did. Yet I think we may detect a subtler
discriminative quality in Webster's most chaotic
periods than we can in Tourneur's; and what
upon this point deserves notice is that Webster,
of the two, alone shows lyrical faculty. His three
dirges are of exquisite melodic rhythm, in a rich
low minor key; much of his blank verse has the
ring of music; and even his prose suggests the
colour of song by its cadence. This cannot be
said of the sinister and arid Muse of Tourneur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
She wears no evergreens of singing, nay, no yew-boughs
even, on her forehead. Her dusky eyes
sparkle with sharp metallic scintillations, as when
Castiza says to her mother:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come from that poisonous woman there.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>The Revenger's Tragedy</i> is an entangled web of
lust, incest, fratricide, rape, adultery, mutual
suspicion, hate, and bloodshed, through which
runs, like a thread of glittering copper, the
vengeance of a cynical plague-fretted spirit.
Vendice emerges from the tainted crew of Duke
and Duchess, Lussurioso, Spurio and Junior,
Ambitioso and Supervacuo, with a kind of blasted
splendour. They are curling and engendering, a
brood of flat-headed asps, in the slime of their
filthy appetites and gross ambitions. He treads
and tramples, on them all. But he bears on his
own forehead the brands of Lucifer, the rebel, and
of Cain, the assassin. The social corruption
which transformed them into reptiles, has made
him a fiend incarnate. Penetrated to the core
with evil, conscious of sin far more than they are,
he towers above them by his satanic force of purpose.
Though ruined, as they are ruined, and by
like causes, he maintains the dignity of mind and
of volition. The right is on his side; the right of
a tyrannicide, who has seen his own mistress, his
own father, the wife of his friend, done to death
by the brutalities of wanton princelings. But
Tourneur did not choose to gift Vendice with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
elevation of nature. In the strongest scene of the
play he showed this scorpion of revenge, stooping
to feign a pander's part, tempting his mother and
his sister as none but a moral leper could have
done. In the minor scene of the duke's murder,
he made him malicious beyond the scope of human
cruelty and outrage. It was inherent apparently
in this poet's conception of life that evil should be
proclaimed predominant. His cynicism stands
self-revealed in the sentence he puts into
Antonio's mouth, condemning Vendice to
death:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You that would murder him would murder me.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Even justice, in his view, rests on egotism. And
yet Tourneur has endowed Vendice with redeeming
qualities. The hero of this crooked play is true
to his ideal of duty, true to his sense of honour.
He dies contented because he has perfected his
revenge, preserved his sister's chastity, and converted
his mother at the poniard's point. Where
all are so bad and base, Vendice appears by comparison
sublime. If we are to admire tone and
keeping in a work of art, we certainly find it here;
for the moral gradations are relentlessly scaled
within the key of sin and pollution. The only
character who stirs a pulse of sympathy is vicious.
Castiza is a mere lay figure, and her mother one
of the most repulsive personages of the Jacobean
drama.</p>

<p>Webster presents a larger mass of dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
work to the critic. Beside the tragedies included
in this volume, he wrote another tragedy,
<i>Appius and Virginia</i>, a tragi-comedy entitled
<i>The Devil's Law-case</i>, and is said to have had a
share in the history-play of <i>Sir Thomas Wyatt</i>,
and in three comedies, <i>Northward Ho, Westward
Ho,</i> and <i>A Cure for a Cuckold. The Devil's Law-case</i>
shows how much this playwright depended on
material supplied him, and how little he could
trust his own inventive faculty. It starts with an
involved plot of Italian deceit and contemplated
crime, which Webster develops in his careful but
not very lucid manner. We feel that we are
working toward some sinister <i>dénouement</i>, when
suddenly, by a twist of the hand, a favourable
turn is given to events, and the play ends happily&mdash;violating
probability, artistic tone, and the
ethical integrity of the chief character, Romelio.
From <i>The Famous History of Sir Thomas Wyatt</i> in
its present mangled and misshapen form it is impossible
to disengage Webster's handiwork with
any certainty. The same may be said about the
brisk and well-wrought pieces <i>Northward Ho</i> and
<i>Westward Ho</i>. Yet I see no reason to dispute
Webster's share in these three plays. <i>A Cure for
a Cuckold</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> requires more particular comment. This
comedy was ascribed by the publisher Kirkman to
John Webster and William Rowley. But the
ascription stands for absolutely nothing, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
we can discover corroborative internal evidence of
Webster's collaboration. Such evidence I do not
find, although there is certainly nothing in the play
to disprove Kirkman's assertions. It should be
added that a delicate little piece of serio-comic
workmanship lies embedded in the otherwise
trashy <i>Cure for a Cuckold</i>. Mr. Edmund Gosse
early saw and twice pointed out how easily this
play within the play could be detached from the
rest; and the Honourable S. E. Spring Rice has
recently printed, at Mr. Daniel's private press, a
beautiful edition of what, following Mr. Gosse's
suggestion, he calls <i>Love's Graduate</i>. I should
like to believe that "piece of silver-work," as Mr.
Gosse has aptly called it, to be truly the creation
of Webster, "the sculptor whose other groups
are all in bronze." Indeed, there are no reasons
why the belief should not be indulged, except that
Kirkman's ascription carries but a feather's
weight, and that there is nothing special in the
style to warrant it. <i>Love's Graduate</i>, rescued from
<i>A Cure for a Cuckold</i> by pious hands, is one of the
unclaimed masterpieces of this fruitful epoch.</p>

<p>The great length of Webster's two Italian
tragedies rendered it impossible to print <i>Appius
and Virginia</i> in this volume. That is much to be
regretted; for without a study of his Roman play,
justice can hardly be done to the scope and
breadth of Webster's genius. Of <i>Appius and
Virginia</i> Mr. Dyce observed with excellent judgment:
"this drama is so remarkable for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
simplicity, its deep pathos, its unobtrusive beauties,
its singleness of plot, and the easy, unimpeded
march of its story, that perhaps there are readers
who will prefer it to any other of our author's
productions." Webster, who was a Latin scholar,
probably studied the fable in Livy; but its outlines
were familiar to English people through
Painter's "Palace of Pleasure." He has drawn
the mutinous camp before Algidum, the discontented
city ruled by a licentious noble, the stern
virtues of Icilius and Virginius, and the innocent
girlhood of Virginia with a quiet mastery and self-restraint
which prove that the violent contrasts
of his Italian plays were calculated for a peculiar
effect of romance. When treating a classical
subject, he aimed at classical severity of form.
The chief interest of the drama centres in Appius.
This character suited Webster's vein. He delighted
in the delineation of a bold, imperious
tyrant, marching through crimes to the attainment
of his lawless ends, yet never wholly despicable.
He also loved to analyse the subtleties of
a deep-brained intriguer, changing from open force
to covert guile, fawning and trampling on the
objects of his hate by turns, assuming the tone of
diplomacy and the truculence of autocratic will at
pleasure, on one occasion making the worse appear
the better cause by rhetoric, on another espousing
evil with reckless cynicism. The variations of
such a character are presented with force and
lucidity in <i>Appius</i>. Yet the whole play lacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
those sudden flashes of illuminative beauty, those
profound and searching glimpses into the bottomless
abyss of human misery, which render
Webster's two Italian tragedies unique. He
seems to have been writing under self-imposed
limitations, in order to obtain a certain desired
effect&mdash;much in the same way as Ford did when
he composed the irreproachable but somewhat
chilling history of <i>Perkin Warbeck</i>.</p>

<p>The detailed criticism of Webster as a
dramatist, and the study of his two chief
tragedies in relation to their Italian sources,
would lead me beyond the limits of this Introduction.
He is not a poet to be dealt with by any
summary method; for he touches the depths of
human nature in ways that need the subtlest
analysis for their proper explanation. I am, however,
loth to close this introduction without a
word or two concerning the peculiarities of
Webster's dramatic style.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Owing to condensation
of thought and compression of language, his
plays offer considerable difficulties to readers who
approach them for the first time. So many
fantastic incidents are crowded into a single
action, and the dialogue is burdened with so
much profoundly studied matter, that the general
impression is apt to be blurred. We rise from
the perusal of his Italian tragedies with a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
sense of the poet's power and personality, an
ineffaceable recollection of one or two resplendent
scenes, and a clear conception of the leading
characters. Meanwhile the outlines of the fable,
the structure of the drama as a complete work of
art, seem to elude our grasp. The persons, who
have played their part upon the stage of our
imagination, stand apart from one another, like
figures in a <i>tableau vivant. Appius and Virginia</i>,
indeed, proves that Webster understood the value
of a simple plot, and that he was able to work one
out with conscientious firmness. But in <i>Vittoria
Corombona</i> and <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i>, each part is
etched with equal effort after luminous effect upon a
murky background; and the whole play is a mosaic
of these parts. It lacks the breadth which comes
from concentration on a master-motive. We feel
that the author had a certain depth of tone and
intricacy of design in view, combining sensational
effect and sententious pregnancy of diction in
works of laboured art. It is probable that able
representation upon the public stage of an
Elizabethan theatre gave them the coherence, the
animation, and the movement which a chamber-student
misses. When familiarity has brought
us acquainted with Webster's way of working,
we perceive that he treats terrible and striking
subjects with a concentrated vigour special to his
genius. Each word and trait of character has
been studied for a particular effect. Brief lightning
flashes of acute self-revelation illuminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
the midnight darkness of the lost souls he has
painted. Flowers of the purest and most human
pathos, like Giovanni de Medici's dialogue with
his uncle in <i>Vittoria Corombona</i>, bloom by the
charnel-house on which the poet's fancy loved
to dwell. The culmination of these tragedies,
setting like stormy suns in blood-red clouds, is
prepared by gradual approaches and degrees of
horror. No dramatist showed more consummate
ability in heightening terrific effects, in laying
bare the inner mysteries of crime, remorse, and
pain combined to make men miserable. He
seems to have had a natural bias toward the
dreadful stuff with which he deals so powerfully.
He was drawn to comprehend and reproduce
abnormal elements of spiritual anguish. The
materials with which he builds are sought for in
the ruined places of abandoned lives, in the
agonies of madness and despair, in the sarcasms
of reckless atheism, in slow tortures, griefs beyond
endurance, the tempests of sin-haunted conscience,
the spasms of fratricidal bloodshed, the deaths of
frantic hope-deserted criminals. He is often
melodramatic in the means employed to bring
these psychological elements of tragedy home to
our imagination. He makes free use of poisoned
engines, daggers, pistols, disguised murderers,
masques, and nightmares. Yet his firm grasp
upon the essential qualities of diseased and guilty
human nature, his profound pity for the innocent
who suffer shipwreck in the storm of evil passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
not their own, save him, even at his gloomiest
and wildest, from the unrealities and extravagances
into which less potent artists&mdash;Tourneur,
for example&mdash;blundered. That the tendency to
brood on what is ghastly belonged to Webster's
idiosyncrasy appears in his use of metaphor. He
cannot say the simplest thing without giving it a
sinister turn&mdash;as thus:</p>

<p>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17.5em;">You speak as if a man</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Should know what fowl is <i>coffined</i> in a baked meat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Afore you cut it open.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When knaves come to preferment, they rise <i>as gallowses</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>are raised</i> in the Low Countries, one upon another's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">shoulders.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pleasure of life! what is't? only the <i>good hours of an</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>ague</i>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I would sooner <i>eat a dead pigeon taken from the soles of</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>the feet of one sick of the plague</i> than kiss one of you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">fasting.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In his dialogue, people bandy phrases like&mdash;"O
you screech-owl!" and "Thou foul black cloud!"
A sister warns her brother to think twice before
committing suicide, with this weird admonition:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">I prithee, yet remember</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Millions are now in graves, which at last day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like mandrakes shall rise shrieking.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But enough has now been said about these
peculiarities of Webster's dramatic style. It is
needful to become acclimatised to his specific
mannerism, both in the way of working and the
tone of thinking, before we can appreciate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
real greatness as a dramatic poet and moralist.
Then we recognise the truth of what has recently
been written of him by an acute and sympathetic
critic: "There is no poet morally nobler than
Webster."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><i>The White Divel; or, the Tragedy of Paulo
Giordano Ursini, Duke of Brachiano,
With the Life and Death of Vittoria
Corombona, the famous Venetian Curtizan</i>,
was printed in 1612, as acted by the
Queen's servants, and again in 1631,
1665, and 1672. In 1707 Nahum Tate
published an alteration called <i>Injured Love; or, the Cruel
Husband</i>.</p>

<p>Webster founded this play directly on the history of the
Duke di Brachiano and his two wives, of whom the second,
Vittoria Accorambaoni, was the widow of the nephew of
Cardinal Montalto, afterwards Pope Sixtus V.</p>

<h3>TO THE READER.</h3>


<p>In publishing this tragedy, I do but
challenge to myself that liberty which
other men have ta'en before me: not
that I affect praise by it, for <i>nos hæc
novimus esse nihil</i>;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> only, since it was
acted in so dull a time of winter, presented
in so open and black a theatre,
that it wanted (that which is the only grace and setting-out
of a tragedy) a full and understanding auditory; and
that, since that time, I have noted most of the people that
come to that play-house resemble those ignorant asses who,
visiting stationers' shops, their use is not to inquire for
good books, but new books; I present it to the general
view with this confidence,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nec ronchos metues maligniorum,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nec scombris tunicas dabis molestas.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>If it be objected this is no true dramatic poem, I shall
easily confess it; <i>non potes in nugas dicere plura meas ipse ego
quam dixi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Willingly, and not ignorantly, in this kind
have I faulted: for, should a man present to such an auditory
the most sententious tragedy that ever was written,
observing all the critical laws, as height of style, and
gravity of person, enrich it with the sententious Chorus,
and, as it were, liven death in the passionate and weighty
Nuntius; yet, after all this divine rapture, <i>O dura messorum
ilia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the breath that comes from the uncapable multitude
is able to poison it; and, ere it be acted, let the author
resolve to fix to every scene this of Horace,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hæc porcis hodie comedenda relinques.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>To those who report I was a long time in finishing this
tragedy, I confess, I do not write with a goose quill winged
with two feathers; and if they will needs make it my fault,
I must answer them with that of Euripides to Alcestides,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
a tragic writer. Alcestides objecting that Euripides had
only, in three days, composed three verses, whereas himself
had written three hundred, "Thou tellest truth," quoth
he, "but here's the difference,&mdash;thine shall only be read
for three days, whereas mine shall continue three ages."</p>

<p>Detraction is the sworn friend to ignorance: for mine
own part, I have ever truly cherished my good opinion of
other men's worthy labours; especially of that full and
heightened style of Master Chapman; the laboured and
understanding works of Master Jonson; the no less
worthy composures of the both worthily excellent Master
Beaumont and Master Fletcher; and lastly (without wrong
last to be named), the right happy and copious industry
of Master Shakespeare, Master Dekker, and Master Heywood;
wishing what I write may be read by their light;
protesting that, in the strength of mine own judgment, I
know them so worthy, that though I rest silent in my own
work, yet to most of theirs I dare (without flattery) fix that
of Martial,</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Count <span class="smcap">Lodovico, Antonelli</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gasparo</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Lod.</i> Banished!<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> It grieved me much to hear the sentence.<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> Ha, ha! O Democritus, thy gods<br />
That govern the whole world! courtly reward<br />
And punishment. Fortune's a right whore:<br />
If she give aught, she deals it in small parcels,<br />
That she may take away all at one swoop.<br />
This 'tis to have great enemies:&mdash;God quit<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> them!<br />
Your wolf no longer seems to be a wolf<br />
Than when she's hungry.<br />
<br />
<i>Gasp.</i> You term those enemies<br />
Are men of princely rank.<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> O, I pray for them:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>The violent thunder is adored by those<br />
Are pashed<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in pieces by it.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Come, my lord,<br />
You are justly doomed: look but a little back<br />
Into your former life; you have in three years<br />
Ruined the noblest earldom.<br />
<br />
<i>Gasp.</i> Your followers<br />
Have swallowed you like mummia<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and, being sick<br />
With such unnatural and horrid physic,<br />
Vomit you up i' the kennel.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> All the damnable degrees<br />
Of drinkings have you staggered through: one citizen<br />
Is lord of two fair manors called you master<br />
Only for caviare.<br />
<br />
<i>Gasp.</i> Those noblemen<br />
Which were invited to your prodigal feasts<br />
(Wherein the ph&#339;nix scarce could scape your throats)<br />
Laugh at your misery; as fore-deeming you<br />
An idle meteor, which, drawn forth the earth,<br />
Would be soon lost i' the air.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Jest upon you,<br />
And say you were begotten in an earthquake,<br />
You have ruined such fair lordships.<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> Very good.<br />
This well goes with two buckets: I must tend<br />
The pouring out of either.<br />
<br />
<i>Gasp.</i> Worse than these;<br />
You have acted certain murders here in Rome,<br />
Bloody and full of horror.<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> 'Las, they were flea-bitings.<br />
Why took they not my head, then?<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>
<i>Gasp.</i> O, my lord,<br />
The law doth sometimes mediate, thinks it good<br />
Not ever to steep violent sins in blood:<br />
This gentle penance may both end your crimes,<br />
And in the example better these bad times.<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> So; but I wonder, then, some great men scape<br />
This banishment: there's Paulo Giordano Ursini,<br />
The Duke of Brachiano, now lives in Rome,<br />
And by close panderism seeks to prostitute<br />
The honour of Vittoria Corombona;<br />
Vittoria, she that might have got my pardon<br />
For one kiss to the duke.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Have a full man within you.<br />
We see that trees bear no such pleasant fruit<br />
There where they grew first as where they are new set:<br />
Perfumes, the more they are chafed, the more they render<br />
Their pleasing scents; and so affliction<br />
Expresseth virtue fully, whether true<br />
Or else adulterate.<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> Leave your painted comforts:<br />
I'll make Italian cut-works<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in their guts,<br />
If ever I return.<br />
<br />
<i>Gasp.</i> O, sir!<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> I am patient.<br />
I have seen some ready to be executed<br />
Give pleasant looks and money, and grown familiar<br />
With the knave hangman: so do I: I thank them,<br />
And would account them nobly merciful,<br />
Would they despatch me quickly.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Fare you well:<br />
We shall find time, I doubt not, to repeal<br />
Your banishment.<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> I am ever bound to you:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>This is the world's alms; pray, make use of it.<br />
Great men sell sheep thus to be cut in pieces,<br />
When first they have shorn them bare and sold their fleeces.<br />

<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Can't be otherwise?<br />
Observed you not to-night, my honoured lord,<br />
Which way soe'er you went, she threw her eyes?<br />
I have dealt already with her chambermaid,<br />
Zanche the Moor; and she is wondrous proud<br />
To be the agent for so high a spirit.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><br />
<i>Brach.</i> We are happy above thought, because 'bove merit.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> 'Bove merit!&mdash;we may now talk freely&mdash;'bove
merit! What is't you doubt? her coyness?
that's but the superficies of lust most women have:
yet why should ladies blush to hear that named
which they do not fear to handle? O, they are
politic: they know our desire is increased by the
difficulty of enjoying; whereas satiety is a blunt,
weary, and drowsy passion. If the buttery-hatch at
court stood continually open, there would be nothing
so passionate crowding, nor hot suit after the
beverage.</p>

<p><i>Brach.</i> O, but her jealous husband.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Hang him! a gilder that hath his brains
perished with quick-silver is not more cold in the
liver: the great barriers moulted not more feathers<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
than he hath shed hairs, by the confession of his
doctor: an Irish gamester that will play himself
naked, and then wage all downwards at hazard, is
not more venturous: so unable to please a woman,
that, like a Dutch doublet, all his back is shrunk into
his breeches.<br />
Shrowd you within this closet, good my lord:<br />
Some trick now must be thought on to divide<br />
My brother-in-law from his fair bedfellow.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Brach.</i> O, should she fail to come!</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> I must not have your lordship thus
unwisely amorous. I myself have loved a lady, and
pursued her with a great deal of under-age protestation,
whom some three or four gallants that have
enjoyed would with all their hearts have been glad
to have been rid of: 'tis just like a summer birdcage
in a garden; the birds that are without despair to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
get in, and the birds that are within despair, and are
in a consumption, for fear they shall never get out.
Away, away, my lord! [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Brachiano</span>.<br />

<br />
<i>Cam.</i> I assure you, brother, no; my voyage lies<br />
More northerly, in a far colder clime:<br />
I do not well remember, I protest,<br />
When I last lay with her.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Strange you should lose your count.<br />
<br />
<i>Cam.</i> We never lay together, but ere morning<br />
There grew a flaw<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> between us.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> 'Thad been your part<br />
To have made up that flaw.<br />
<br />
<i>Cam.</i> True, but she loathes<br />
I should be seen in't.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Why, sir, what's the matter?<br />
<br />
<i>Cam.</i> The duke, your master, visits me, I thank him;<br />
And I perceive how, like an earnest bowler,<br />
He very passionately leans that way<br />
He should have his bowl run.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> I hope you do not think&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Cam.</i> That noblemen bowl booty?<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> faith, his cheek<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Hath a most excellent bias; it would fain<br />
Jump with my mistress.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Will you be an ass,<br />
Despite your Aristotle? or a cuckold,<br />
Contrary to your Ephemerides,<br />
Which shows you under what a smiling planet<br />
You were first swaddled?<br />
<br />
<i>Cam.</i> Pew-wew, sir, tell not me<br />
Of planets nor of Ephemerides:<br />
A man may be made a cuckold in the day-time,<br />
When the stars' eyes are out.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Sir, God b' wi' you;<br />
I do commit you to your pitiful pillow<br />
Stuffed with horn-shavings.<br />
<br />
<i>Cam.</i> Brother,&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> God refuse me,<br />
Might I advise you now, your only course<br />
Were to lock up your wife.<br />
<br />
<i>Cam.</i> 'Twere very good.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Bar her the sight of revels.<br />
<br />
<i>Cam.</i> Excellent.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Let her not go to church, but like a hound<br />
In lyam<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> at your heels.<br />
<br />
<i>Cam.</i> 'Twere for her honour.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> And so you should be certain in one fortnight<br />
Despite her chastity or innocence,<br />
To be cuckolded, which yet is in suspense:<br />
This is my counsel, and I ask no fee for't.<br />
<br />
<i>Cam.</i> Come, you know not where my night-cap wrings me.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Wear it o' the old fashion; let your large
ears come through, it will be more easy:&mdash;nay, I will
be bitter:&mdash;bar your wife of her entertainment:
women are more willingly and more gloriously
chaste when they are least restrained of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
liberty. It seems you would be a fine capricious
mathematically jealous coxcomb; take the height of
your own horns with a Jacob's staff<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> afore they are
up. These politic inclosures for paltry mutton make
more rebellion in the flesh than all the provocative
electuaries doctors have uttered<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> since last jubilee.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> This doth not physic me.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> It seems you are jealous: I'll show you
the error of it by a familiar example. I have seen a
pair of spectacles fashioned with such perspective
art, that, lay down but one twelve pence o' the
board, 'twill appear as if there were twenty; now,
should you wear a pair of these spectacles, and see
your wife tying her shoe, you would imagine twenty
hands were taking up of your wife's clothes, and this
would put you into a horrible causeless fury.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> The fault there, sir, is not in the eyesight.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> True; but they that have the yellow
jaundice think all objects they look on to be yellow.
Jealousy is worser; her fits present to a man, like so
many bubbles in a bason of water, twenty several
crabbed faces; many times makes his own shadow
his cuckold-maker. See, she comes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vittoria Corombona</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>What reason have you to be jealous of this creature?
what an ignorant ass or flattering knave might he be
counted, that should write sonnets to her eyes, or
call her brow the snow of Ida or ivory of Corinth, or
compare her hair to the blackbird's bill, when 'tis
liker the blackbird's feather! This is all; be wise, I
will make you friends; and you shall go to bed
together. Marry, look you, it shall not be your
seeking; do you stand upon that by any means:
walk you aloof; I would not have you seen in't.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
[<span class="smcap">Camillo</span> <i>retires.</i>] Sister, my lord attends you in
the banqueting-house. Your husband is wondrous
discontented.</p>

<p><i>Vit. Cor.</i> I did nothing to displease him: I
carved to him at supper-time.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> You need not have carved him, in faith; they
say he is a capon already. I must now seemingly fall
out with you. Shall a gentleman so well descended
as Camillo,&mdash;a lousy slave, that within this twenty
years rode with the black guard<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in the duke's
carriage, 'mongst spits and dripping-pans&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Now he begins to tickle her.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> An excellent scholar,&mdash;one that hath a
head filled with calves-brains without any sage in
them,&mdash;come crouching in the hams to you for a
night's lodging?&mdash;that hath an itch in's hams, which
like the fire at the glass-house hath not gone out this
seven years.&mdash;Is he not a courtly gentleman?&mdash;when
he wears white satin, one would take him by his
black muzzle to be no other creature than a maggot.&mdash;You

<p><i>Cam.</i> He will make her know what is in me.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Come, my lord attends you; thou shalt go
to bed to my lord&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Now he comes to't.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> With a relish as curious as a vintner
going to taste new wine.&mdash;I am opening your case
hard. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Camillo</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> A virtuous brother, o' my credit!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Indeed, I am studying alchymy.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Thou shalt lie in a bed stuffed with turtles'
feathers; swoon in perfumed linen, like the fellow
was smothered in roses. So perfect shall be thy
happiness, that, as men at sea think land and trees
and ships go that way they go, so both Heaven and
earth shall seem to go your voyage. Shall't meet
him; 'tis fixed with nails of diamonds to inevitable
necessity.</p>

<p><i>Vit. Cor.</i> How shall's rid him hence?</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> I will put the breeze in's tail,&mdash;set him
gadding presently.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Camillo</span>] I have almost
wrought her to it, I find her coming: but, might
I advise you now, for this night I would not lie
with her; I would cross her humour to make her
more humble.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Shall I, shall I?</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> It will show in you a supremacy of judgment.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> True, and a mind differing from the tumultuary
opinion; for, <i>quæ negata, grata</i>.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Right: you are the adamant<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> shall draw
her to you, though you keep distance off.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> A philosophical reason.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Walk by her o' the nobleman's fashion,
and tell her you will lie with her at the end of the
progress.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> [<i>Coming forward.</i>] Vittoria, I cannot be
induced, or, as a man would say, incited&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vit. Cor.</i> To do what, sir?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> To lie with you to-night. Your silkworm
useth to fast every third day, and the next following
spins the better. To-morrow at night I am for you.</p>

<p><i>Vit. Cor.</i> You'll spin a fair thread, trust to't.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> But, do you hear, I shall have you steal
to her chamber about midnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Do you think so? why, look you, brother,
because you shall not think I'll gull you, take the
key, lock me into the chamber, and say you shall
be sure of me.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> In troth, I will; I'll be your gaoler once.
But have you ne'er a false door?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> A pox on't, as I am a Christian. Tell me
to-morrow how scurvily she takes my unkind parting.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> I will.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Didst thou not mark the jest of the silkworm?
Good-night: in faith, I will use this trick
often.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Do, do, do. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Camillo</span>; <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Flamineo</span>

ha, ha! thou entanglest thyself in thine own work
like a silkworm. Come, sister; darkness hides your
blush. Women are like curst dogs: civility keeps
them tied all daytime, but they are let loose at
midnight; then they do most good, or most mischief.&mdash;My

Methought I walked about the mid of night<br />
Into a church-yard, where a goodly yew-tree<br />
Spread her large root in ground. Under that yew,<br />
As I sate sadly leaning on a grave<br />
Chequered with cross sticks, there came stealing in<br />
Your duchess and my husband: one of them<br />
A pick-axe bore, the other a rusty spade;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>And in rough terms they gan to challenge me<br />
About this yew.<br />
<br />
<i>Brach.</i> That tree?<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> This harmless yew:<br />
They told me my intent was to root up<br />
That well-grown yew, and plant i' the stead of it<br />
A withered blackthorn; and for that they vowed<br />
To bury me alive. My husband straight<br />
With pick-axe gan to dig, and your fell duchess<br />
With shovel, like a Fury, voided out<br />
The earth, and scattered bones. Lord, how, methought,<br />
I trembled! and yet, for all this terror,<br />
I could not pray.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> No; the devil was in your dream.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> When to my rescue there arose, methought,<br />
A whirlwind, which let fall a massy arm<br />
From that strong plant;<br />
And both were struck dead by that sacred yew,<br />
In that base shallow grave that was their due.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Excellent devil! she hath taught him in a dream<br />
To make away his duchess and her husband.<br />
<br />
<i>Brach.</i> Sweetly shall I interpret this your dream.<br />
You are lodged within his arms who shall protect you<br />
From all the fevers of a jealous husband;<br />
From the poor envy of our phlegmatic duchess.<br />
I'll seat you above law, and above scandal;<br />
Give to your thoughts the invention of delight,<br />
And the fruition; nor shall government<br />
Divide me from you longer than a care<br />
To keep you great: you shall to me at once<br />
Be dukedom, health, wife, children, friends, and all.<br />

To send a duke home without e'er a man?<br />

Which you have hoarded for my maintenance,<br />
That I may bear my beard out of the level<br />

Sold all's land, and, like a fortunate fellow,<br />

For want of means (the university judge me)<br />
I have been fain to heel my tutor's stockings,<br />
At least seven years: conspiring with a beard,<br />
Made me a graduate; then to this duke's service.<br />

I would the common'st courtezan in Rome<br />
Had been my mother, rather than thyself.<br />
Nature is very pitiful to whores,<br />
To give them but few children, yet those children<br />
Plurality of fathers: they are sure<br />
They shall not want. Go, go,<br />
Complain unto my great lord cardinal;<br />
Yet may be he will justify the act.<br />
Lycurgus wondered much men would provide<br />
Good stallions for their mares, and yet would suffer<br />
Their fair wives to be barren.<br />
<br />
<i>Cor.</i> Misery of miseries! [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> The duchess come to court! I like not that.<br />
We are engaged to mischief, and must on:<br />
As rivers to find out the ocean<br />
Flow with crook bendings beneath forcèd banks;<br />
Or as we see, to aspire some mountain's top,<br />
The way ascends not straight, but imitates<br />
The subtle foldings of a winter snake;<br />
So who knows policy and her true aspect,<br />
Shall find her ways winding and indirect.<br />

With a free sceptre in your able hand,<br />
And to the use of nature well applied<br />
High gifts of learning, should in your prime age<br />
Neglect your awful throne for the soft down<br />

<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> An old tale.<br />
Upon a time Ph&#339;bus, the god of light,<br />
Or him we call the Sun, would needs be married:<br />
The gods gave their consent, and Mercury<br />
Was sent to voice it to the general world.<br />
But what a piteous cry there straight arose<br />
Amongst smiths and felt-makers, brewers and cooks,<br />
Reapers and butterwomen, amongst fishmongers,<br />
And thousand other trades, which are annoyed<br />
By his excessive heat! 'twas lamentable.<br />
They came to Jupiter all in a sweat,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>And do forbid the bans. A great fat cook<br />
Was made their speaker, who entreats of Jove<br />
That Ph&#339;bus might be gelded; for, if now,<br />
When there was but one sun, so many men<br />
Were like to perish by his violent heat,<br />
What should they do if he were married,<br />
And should beget more, and those children<br />
Make fire-works like their father? So say I;<br />
Only I will apply it to your wife:<br />
Her issue, should not providence prevent it,<br />
Would make both nature, time, and man repent it.<br />
<br />

Will blast your cornucopia. Marcello<br />

I have letters from him, which are suppliant<br />
To work his quick repeal from banishment:<br />
He means to address himself for pension<br />
Unto our sister duchess.<br />
<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> O, 'twas well:<br />
We shall not want his absence past six days.<br />
I fain would have the Duke Brachiano run<br />
Into notorious scandal; for there's naught<br />
In such cursed dotage to repair his name,<br />
Only the deep sense of some deathless shame.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> It may be objected, I am dishonourable<br />
To play thus with my kinsman; but I answer,<br />
For my revenge I'd stake a brother's life,<br />
That, being wronged, durst not avenge himself.<br />
<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> Come, to observe this strumpet.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> Curse of greatness!<br />
Sure he'll not leave her?<br />
<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> There's small pity in't:<br />
Like misletoe on sear elms spent by weather,<br />
Let him cleave to her, and both rot together.<br />

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Brachiano</span>, <i>with a</i> Conjurer.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Brach.</i> Now, sir, I claim your promise: 'tis dead midnight,<br />
The time prefixed to show me, by your art,<br />
How the intended murder of Camillo<br />
And our loathed duchess grow to action.<br />
<br />
<i>Con.</i> You have won me by your bounty to a deed<br />
I do not often practise. Some there are<br />
Which by sophistic tricks aspire that name,<br />
Which I would gladly lose, of necromancer;<br />
As some that use to juggle upon cards,<br />
Seeming to conjure, when indeed they cheat;<br />
Others that raise up their confederate spirits<br />
'Bout wind-mills, and endanger their own necks<br />
For making of a squib; and some there are<br />
Will keep a curtal<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> to show juggling tricks,<br />
And give out 'tis a spirit: besides these,<br />
Such a whole realm of almanac-makers, figure-flingers,<br />
Fellows, indeed, that only live by stealth,<br />
Since they do merely lie about stol'n goods,<br />
They'd make men think the devil were fast and loose,<br />
With speaking fustian Latin. Pray, sit down:<br />
Put on this night-cap, sir, 'tis charmed; and now<br />
I'll show you, by my strong commanding art,<br />
The circumstance that breaks your duchess' heart.<br />

<h4><span class="smcap">A Dumb Show.</span></h4>

<p><i>Enter suspiciously</i> <span class="smcap">Julio</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Christophero</span>: <i>they
draw a curtain where</i> <span class="smcap">Brachiano's</span> <i>picture is, put
on spectacles of glass, which cover their eyes and
noses, and then burn perfumes before the picture, and
wash the lips; that done, quenching the fire, and
putting off their spectacles, they depart laughing.</i></p>

with lights after her</i>, Count <span class="smcap">Lodovico, Giovanni,
Guidantonio</span>, <i>and others waiting on her: she kneels
down as to prayers, then draws the curtain of the
picture, does three reverences to it, and kisses it
thrice; she faints, and will not suffer them to come
near it; dies: sorrow expressed in</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span> <i>and</i>
Count <span class="smcap">Lodovico</span>: <i>she is conveyed out solemnly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Brach.</i> Excellent! then she's dead.<br />
<br />
<i>Con.</i> She's poisonèd<br />
By the fumed picture. 'Twas her custom nightly,<br />
Before she went to bed, to go and visit<br />
Your picture, and to feed her eyes and lips<br />
On the dead shadow. Doctor Julio,<br />
Observing this, infects it with an oil<br />
And other poisoned stuff, which presently<br />
Did suffocate her spirits.<br />
<br />
<i>Brach.</i> Methought I saw<br />
Count Lodowick there.<br />
<br />
<i>Con.</i> He was: and by my art<br />
I find he did most passionately dote<br />
Upon your duchess. Now turn another way,<br />
And view Camillo's far more politic fate.<br />
Strike louder, music, from this charmèd ground,<br />
To yield, as fits the act, a tragic sound!<br />

You saw them enter, charged with their deep healths<br />
To their boon voyage; and, to second that,<br />
Flamineo calls to have a vaulting-horse<br />
Maintain their sport; the virtuous Marcello<br />
Is innocently plotted forth the room;<br />

For, sir, you know we have naught but circumstances<br />
To charge her with, about her husband's death:<br />
Their approbation, therefore, to the proofs<br />
Of her black lust shall make her infamous<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Flamineo</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Marcello</span> <i>guarded, and a</i>
Lawyer.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Law.</i> What, are you in by the week? so, I will
try now whether thy wit be close prisoner. Methinks
none should sit upon thy sister but old whore-masters.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Or cuckolds; for your cuckold is your most
terrible tickler of lechery. Whore-masters would
serve; for none are judges at tilting but those that
have been old tilters.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> My lord duke and she have been very
private.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> You are a dull ass; 'tis threatened they
have been very public.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> If it can be proved they have but kissed one
another&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> What then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Law.</i> My lord cardinal will ferret them.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> A cardinal, I hope, will not catch conies.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> For to sow kisses (mark what I say), to sow
kisses is to reap lechery; and, I am sure, a woman
that will endure kissing is half won.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> True, her upper part, by that rule: if you
will win her nether part too, you know what
follows.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> Hark; the ambassadors are lighted.</p>

<p>
<i>Flam.</i> [<i>Aside</i>]. I do put on this feignèd garb of mirth<br />
To gull suspicion.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> O my unfortunate sister!<br />
I would my dagger-point had cleft her heart<br />
When she first saw Brachiano: you, 'tis said,<br />
Were made his engine and his stalking-horse,<br />
To undo my sister.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> I am a kind of path<br />
To her and mine own preferment.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Your ruin.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Hum! thou art a soldier,<br />
Follow'st the great duke, feed'st his victories,<br />
As witches do their serviceable spirits,<br />
Even with thy prodigal blood: what hast got,<br />
But, like the wealth of captains, a poor handful,<br />
Which in thy palm thou bear'st as men hold water?<br />
Seeking to gripe it fast, the frail reward<br />
Steals through thy fingers.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Sir!<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Thou hast scarce maintenance<br />
To keep thee in fresh shamois.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Brother!<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Hear me:&mdash;<br />
And thus, when we have even poured ourselves<br />
Into great fights, for their ambition<br />
Or idle spleen, how shall we find reward?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>But as we seldom find the misletoe<br />
Sacred to physic, or the builder oak,<br />
Without a mandrake by it; so in our quest of gain,<br />
Alas, the poorest of their forced dislikes<br />
At a limb proffers, but at heart it strikes!<br />
This is lamented doctrine.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> Come, come.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> When age shall turn thee<br />
White as a blooming hawthorn&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> I'll interrupt you:&mdash;<br />
For love of virtue bear an honest heart,<br />
And stride o'er every politic respect,<br />
Which, where they most advance, they most infect.<br />
Were I your father, as I am your brother,<br />
I should not be ambitious to leave you<br />
A better patrimony.<br />
<br />

The lord ambassadors.<br />
[<i>The</i> Ambassadors <i>pass over the stage severally.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> O my sprightly Frenchman!&mdash;Do you know
him? he's an admirable tilter.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> I saw him at last tilting: he showed like
a pewter candlestick, fashioned like a man in armour,
holding a tilting-staff in his hand, little bigger than
a candle of twelve i' the pound.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> O, but he's an excellent horseman.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> A lame one in his lofty tricks: he sleeps
a-horseback, like a poulter.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><i>Law.</i> Lo you, my Spaniard!</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> He carries his face in's ruff, as I have seen
a serving man carry glasses in a cypress hatband,
monstrous steady, for fear of breaking: he looks like
the claw of a blackbird, first salted, and then broiled
in a candle. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> A lawyer that pleads against you.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> Pray, my lord, let him speak his usual tongue;<br />
I'll make no answer else.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> Why, you understand Latin.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> I do, sir; but amongst this auditory<br />
Which come to hear my cause, the half or more<br />
May be ignorant in't.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> Go on, sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> By your favour,<br />
I will not have my accusation clouded<br />
In a strange tongue; all this assembly<br />
Shall hear what you can charge me with.<br />
<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> Signior,<br />
You need not stand on't much; pray, change your language.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i>  O, for God sake!&mdash;Gentlewoman, your credit<br />
Shall be more famous by it.<br />
<br />

<i>Vit. Cor.</i> I am at the mark, sir: I'll give aim to you,<br />
And tell you how near you shoot.<br />

So to connive your judgments to the view<br />
Of this debauched and diversivolent woman;<br />
Who such a black concatenation<br />
Of mischief hath effected, that to extirp<br />
The memory of't, must be the consummation<br />
Of her and her projections,&mdash;<br />

<i>Vit. Cor.</i> What's all this?<br />
<br />
<i>Law.</i> Hold your peace:<br />
Exorbitant sins must have exulceration.<br />
<br />

Some pothecaries' bills, or proclamations;<br />
And now the hard and undigestible words<br />
Come up, like stones we use give hawks for physic;<br />
Why, this is Welsh to Latin.<br />
<br />
<i>Law.</i> My lords, the woman<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>Knows not her tropes nor figures, nor is perfect<br />
In the academic derivation<br />
Of grammatical elocution.<br />
<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> Sir, your pains<br />
Shall be well spared, and your deep eloquence<br />
Be worthily applauded amongst those<br />
Which understand you.<br />

<i>Fran. de Med.</i> Sir,<br />
Put up your papers in your fustian bag,&mdash;<br />
[<span class="smcap">Francisco</span> <i>speaks this as in scorn.</i><br />
Cry mercy, sir, 'tis buckram&mdash;and accept<br />
My notion of your learned verbosity.<br />
<br />
<i>Law.</i> I most graduatically thank your lordship:<br />
I shall have use for them elsewhere.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> I shall be plainer with you, and paint out<br />
Your follies in more natural red and white<br />
Than that upon your cheek. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> O you mistake:<br />
You raise a blood as noble in this cheek<br />
As ever was your mother's.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> I must spare you, till proof cry "whore" to that.&mdash;<br />
Observe this creature here, my honoured lords,<br />
A woman of a most prodigious spirit,<br />
In her effected.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> Honourable my lord,<br />
It doth not suit a reverend cardinal<br />
To play the lawyer thus.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> O, your trade instructs your language.&mdash;<br />
You see, my lords, what goodly fruit she seems;<br />
Yet, like those apples<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> travellers report<br />
To grow where Sodom and Gomorrah stood,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>I will but touch her, and you straight shall see<br />
She'll fall to soot and ashes.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> Your envenomed<br />
Pothecary should do't.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> I am resolved,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a><br />
Were there a second Paradise to lose,<br />
This devil would betray it.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> O poor charity!<br />
Thou art seldom found in scarlet.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> Who knows not how, when several night by night<br />
Her gates were choked with coaches, and her rooms<br />
Outbraved the stars with several kind of lights;<br />
When she did counterfeit a prince's court<br />
In music, banquets, and most riotous surfeits?<br />
This whore, forsooth, was holy.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> Ha! whore! what's that!<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> Shall I expound whore to you? sure, I shall;<br />
I'll give their perfect character. They are first,<br />
Sweetmeats which rot the eater; in man's nostrils<br />
Poisoned perfumes: they are cozening alchemy;<br />
Shipwrecks in calmest weather. What are whores!<br />
Cold Russian winters, that appear so barren<br />
As if that nature had forgot the spring:<br />
They are the true material fire of hell:<br />
Worse than those tributes i' the Low Countries paid,<br />
Exactions upon meat, drink, garments, sleep,<br />
Ay, even on man's perdition, his sin:<br />
They are those brittle evidences of law<br />
Which forfeit all a wretched man's estate<br />
For leaving out one syllable. What are whores!<br />
They are those flattering bells have all one tune,<br />
At weddings and at funerals. Your rich whores<br />
Are only treasuries by extortion filled,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>And emptied by cursed riot. They are worse,<br />
Worse than dead bodies which are begged at gallows,<br />
And wrought upon by surgeons, to teach man<br />
Wherein he is imperfect. What's a whore!<br />
She's like the guilty counterfeited coin<br />
Which, whosoe'er first stamps it, brings in trouble<br />
All that receive it.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> This character scapes me.<br />
<br />

Take from all beasts and from all minerals<br />
Their deadly poison&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> Well, what then?<br />
<br />

I'll find in thee a pothecary's shop,<br />
To sample them all.<br />
<br />
<i>Fr. Am.</i> She hath lived ill.<br />
<br />

Enters the devil murder.<br />
<br />

Husband is dead.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> O, he's a happy husband:<br />
Now he owes nature nothing.<br />
<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> And by a vaulting-engine.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> An active plot; he jumped into his grave.<br />
<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> What a prodigy was't<br />
That from some two yards' height a slender man<br />
Should break his neck!<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> I' the rushes!<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a><br />
<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> And what's more,<br />
Upon the instant lose all use of speech,<br />
All vital motion, like a man had lain<br />
Wound up three days. Now mark each circumstance.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><br />
<i>Mont.</i> And look upon this creature was his wife.<br />
She comes not like a widow; she comes armed<br />
With scorn and impudence: is this a mourning-habit?<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> Had I foreknown his death, as you suggest,<br />
I would have bespoke my mourning.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> O, you are cunning.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> You shame your wit and judgment,<br />
To call it so. What! is my just defence<br />
By him that is my judge called impudence?<br />
Let me appeal, then, from this Christian court<br />
To the uncivil Tartar.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> See, my lords,<br />
She scandals our proceedings.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> Humbly thus,<br />
Thus low, to the most worthy and respected<br />
Lieger ambassadors, my modesty<br />
And womanhood I tender; but withal,<br />
So entangled in a cursèd accusation,<br />
That my defence, of force, like Perseus,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a><br />
Must personate masculine virtue. To the point.<br />
Find me but guilty, sever head from body,<br />
We'll part good friends: I scorn to hold my life<br />
At yours or any man's entreaty, sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Eng. Am.</i> She hath a brave spirit.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> Well, well, such counterfeit jewels<br />
Make true ones oft suspected.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> You are deceived:<br />
For know, that all your strict-combinèd heads,<br />
Which strike against this mine of diamonds,<br />
Shall prove but glassen hammers,&mdash;they shall break.<br />
These are but feignèd shadows of my evils:<br />
Terrify babes, my lord, with painted devils;<br />
I am past such needless palsy. For your names<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Of whore and murderess, they proceed from you,<br />
As if a man should spit against the wind;<br />
The filth returns in's face.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> Pray you, mistress, satisfy me one question:<br />
Who lodged beneath your roof that fatal night<br />
Your husband brake his neck?<br />
<br />
<i>Brach.</i> That question<br />
Enforceth me break silence: I was there.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> Your business?<br />
<br />
<i>Brach.</i> Why, I came to comfort her,<br />
And take some course for settling her estate,<br />
Because I heard her husband was in debt<br />
To you, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> He was.<br />
<br />
<i>Brach.</i> And 'twas strangely feared<br />
That you would cozen<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> her.<br />
<br />

I do not think she hath a soul so black<br />
To act a deed so bloody: if she have,<br />
As in cold countries husbandmen plant vines,<br />

<p><i>Fran. de Med.</i> First, your intelligencers, pray, let's see.</p>

By taking up commodities;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> for politic bankrupts;<br />

At birth of their first children.<br />

That go in men's apparel; for usurers<br />
That share with scriveners for their good reportage;<br />
For lawyers that will antedate their writs:<br />
And some divines you might find folded there,<br />
But that I slip them o'er for conscience' sake.<br />
Here is a general catalogue of knaves:<br />
A man might study all the prisons o'er,<br />
Yet never attain this knowledge.<br />

Fold down the leaf, I pray.<br />
Good my lord, let me borrow this strange doctrine.<br />

<br />
<i>Fran. de Med.</i> I do assure your lordship,<br />
You are a worthy member of the state,<br />
And have done infinite good in your discovery<br />
Of these offenders.<br />

To leave your lordship.<br />

If any ask for me at court, report<br />
You have left me in the company of knaves.<br />
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Monticelso</span>.<br />

From a clerk's desk up to a justice' chair,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Hath made this knavish summons, and intends,<br />
As the Irish rebels wont were to sell heads,<br />
So to make prize of these. And thus it happens,<br />

Are razed out of the knaves' record; or else<br />
My lord he winks at them with easy will;<br />
His man grows rich, the knaves are the knaves still.<br />
But to the use I'll make of it; it shall serve<br />
To point me out a list of murderers,<br />
Agents for any villany. Did I want<br />
Ten leash of courtezans, it would furnish me;<br />
Nay, laundress three armies. That in so little paper<br />
Should lie the undoing of so many men!<br />
'Tis not so big as twenty declarations.<br />
See the corrupted use some make of books:<br />
Divinity, wrested by some factious blood,<br />
Draws swords, swells battles, and o'erthrows all good.<br />
To fashion my revenge more seriously,<br />
Let me remember my dead sister's face:<br />
Call for her picture? no, I'll close mine eyes,<br />
And in a melancholic thought I'll frame<br />

Her figure 'fore me. Now I ha't:&mdash;how strong<br />
Imagination works! how she can frame<br />
Things which are not! Methinks she stands afore me,<br />
And by the quick idea of my mind,<br />
Were my skill pregnant, I could draw her picture.<br />
Thought, as a subtle juggler, makes us deem<br />
Things supernatural, which yet have cause<br />
Common as sickness. 'Tis my melancholy.&mdash;<br />
How cam'st thou by thy death?&mdash;How idle am I<br />
To question mine own idleness!&mdash;Did ever<br />

That have to meditate upon revenge?<br />

So, now 'tis ended, like an old wife's story:<br />
Statesmen think often they see stranger sights<br />
Than madmen. Come, to this weighty business:<br />
My tragedy must have some idle mirth in't,<br />
Else it will never pass. I am in love,<br />
In love with Corombona; and my suit<br />
Thus halts to her in verse.&mdash;[<i>Writes.</i><br />

to this crocodile; flies into the jaws of't,
picks out the worm, and brings present remedy.
The fish, glad of ease, but ingrateful to her that
did it, that the bird may not talk largely of her
abroad for non-payment, closeth her chaps, intending
to swallow her, and so put her to perpetual
silence. But nature, loathing such ingratitude,
hath armed this bird with a quill or prick in the
head, the top o' which wounds the crocodile i' the
mouth, forceth her to open her bloody prison, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>

These several habits?<br />

Of several orders:<br />
That lord i' the black cloak, with the silver cross,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>Is Knight of Rhodes; the next, Knight of St. Michael;<br />
That, of the Golden Fleece; the Frenchman, there,<br />
Knight of the Holy Ghost; my lord of Savoy,<br />
Knight of the Annunciation; the Englishman<br />
Is Knight of the honoured Garter, dedicated<br />
Unto their saint, St. George. I could describe to you<br />
Their several institutions, with the laws<br />

Of any cardinal. When first they enter,<br />
'Tis lawful for the ambassadors of princes<br />
To enter with them, and to make their suit<br />

<p>
<i>Flam.</i> In all the weary minutes of my life,<br />
Day ne'er broke up till now. This marriage<br />
Confirms me happy.<br />
<br />
<i>Hort.</i> 'Tis a good assurance.<br />
Saw you not yet the Moor that's come to court?<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Yes, and conferred with him i'the duke's closet:<br />
I have not seen a goodlier personage,<br />
Nor ever talked with man better experienced<br />
In state affairs or rudiments of war:<br />
He hath, by report, served the Venetian<br />
In Candy these twice seven years, and been chief<br />
In many a bold design.<br />
<br />
<i>Hort.</i> What are those two<br />
That bear him company?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Two noblemen of Hungary, that, living in
the emperor's service as commanders, eight years
since, contrary to the expectation of all the court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
entered into religion, into the strict order of Capuchins:
but, being not well settled in their undertaking,
they left their order, and returned to court; for
which, being after troubled in conscience, they
vowed their service against the enemies of Christ,
went to Malta, were there knighted, and in their
return back, at this great solemnity, they are resolved
for ever to forsake the world, and settle themselves
here in a house of Capuchins in Padua.</p>

<p><i>Hort.</i> 'Tis strange.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> One thing makes it so: they have vowed
for ever to wear, next their bare bodies, those coats
of mail they served in.</p>

<p><i>Hort.</i> Hard penance! Is the Moor a Christian?</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> He is.</p>

<p><i>Hort.</i> Why proffers he his service to our duke?</p>

<p>
<i>Flam.</i> Because he understands there's like to grow<br />
Some wars between us and the Duke of Florence,<br />
In which he hopes employment.<br />
I never saw one in a stern bold look<br />
Wear more command, nor in a lofty phrase<br />
Express more knowing or more deep contempt<br />
Of our slight airy courtiers. He talks<br />
As if he had travelled all the princes' courts<br />
Of Christendom: in all things strives to express,<br />
That all that should dispute with him may know,<br />
Glories, like glow-worms, afar off shine bright,<br />
But looked to near, have neither heat nor light.&mdash;<br />
The duke!<br />

How is't, brave soldier? O, that I had seen<br />
Some of your iron days! I pray, relate<br />
Some of your service to us.<br />

<p><i>Fran. de Med.</i> 'Tis a ridiculous thing for a man
to be his own chronicle: I did never wash my mouth
with mine own praise for fear of getting a stinking
breath.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> You're too stoical. The duke will expect
other discourse from you.</p>

<p><i>Fran. de Med.</i> I shall never flatter him: I have
studied man too much to do that. What difference
is between the duke and I? no more than between
two bricks, all made of one clay: only 't may be one
is placed on the top of a turret, the other in the
bottom of a well, by mere chance. If I were placed
as high as the duke, I should stick as fast, make as
fair a show, and bear out weather equally.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> [<i>Aside</i>]. If this soldier had a patent to
beg in churches, then he would tell them stories.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I have been a soldier too.</p>

<p><i>Fran. de Med.</i> How have you thrived?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Faith, poorly.</p>

<p><i>Fran. de Med.</i> That's the misery of peace: only
outsides are then respected. As ships seem very
great upon the river, which show very little upon
the seas, so some men i' the court seem colossuses
in a chamber, who, if they came into the field, would
appear pitiful pigmies.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Give me a fair room yet hung with arras,
and some great cardinal to lug me by the ears as his
endeared minion.</p>

<p><i>Fran. de Med.</i> And thou mayst do the devil
knows what villany.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> And safely.</p>

<p><i>Fran. de Med.</i> Right: you shall see in the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
in harvest-time, pigeons, though they destroy never
so much corn, the farmer dare not present the
fowling-piece to them: why? because they belong
to the lord of the manor; whilst your poor sparrows,
that belong to the Lord of Heaven, they go to the
pot for't.</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> I will now give you some politic instructions.
The duke says he will give you a pension:
that's but bare promise; get it under his hand.
For I have known men that have come from serving
against the Turk, for three or four months they have
had pension to buy them new wooden legs and fresh
plasters; but, after, 'twas not to be had. And this
miserable courtesy shows as if a tormentor should
give hot cordial drinks to one three quarters dead
o' the rack, only to fetch the miserable soul again to
endure more dogdays.

Æsop had a foolish dog that let go the flesh to
catch the shadow: I would have courtiers be better
divers.</p>

<p><i>Zanche.</i> You remember your oaths?</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Lovers' oaths are like mariners' prayers,
uttered in extremity; but when the tempest is o'er,
and that the vessel leaves tumbling, they fall from
protesting to drinking. And yet, amongst gentlemen
protesting and drinking go together, and agree as
well as shoemakers and Westphalia bacon: they are
both drawers on; for drink draws on protestation
and protestation draws on more drink. Is not this
discourse better now than the morality of your sun-burnt
gentleman?</p>

of the presentment; so I may come to you in the

flatterers are but the shadows of princes' bodies;

And let the cause live. Shall we groan in irons,<br />
Or be a shameful and a weighty burden<br />
To a public scaffold? This is my resolve;<br />
I would not live at any man's entreaty,<br />
Nor die at any's bidding.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> Will you hear me?<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> My life hath done service to other men;<br />
My death shall serve mine own turn. Make you ready.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Flam.</i> With as much pleasure<br />
As e'er my father gat me.<br />
<br />

<br />

Yet we carouse it off;&mdash;Cry out for help!&mdash;<br />
[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Zanche</span>.<br />

The world, to sink to that was made for devils,<br />

<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Leave your prating,<br />
For these are but grammatical laments,<br />
Feminine arguments: and they move me,<br />
As some in pulpits move their auditory,<br />
More with their exclamation than sense<br />

Seem to consent, only persuade him teach<br />
The way to death; let him die first.<br />
<br />

To kill one's self is meat that we must take<br />
Like pills, not chew't, but quickly swallow it;<br />
The smart o' the wound, or weakness of the hand,<br />
May else bring treble torments.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> I have held it<br />
A wretched and most miserable life<br />
Which is not able to die.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> O, but frailty!<br />
Yet I am now resolved: farewell, affliction!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>Behold, Brachiano, I that while you lived<br />
Did make a flaming altar of my heart<br />
To sacrifice unto you, now am ready<br />
To sacrifice heart and all.&mdash;Farewell, Zanche!<br />

Especially when my best self, Flamineo,<br />
Goes the same voyage?<br />
<br />

<br />

Since it is most necessary one of us<br />
Do violence on ourselves,&mdash;let you or I<br />
Be her sad taster, teach her how to die.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Thou dost instruct me nobly: take these pistols,<br />
Because my hand is stained with blood already:<br />
Two of these you shall level at my breast,<br />
The other 'gainst your own, and so we'll die<br />
Most equally contented: but first swear<br />
Not to outlive me.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor. and Zanche.</i> Most religiously.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Then here's an end of me; farewell, daylight!<br />
And, O contemptible physic, that dost take<br />
So long a study, only to preserve<br />
So short a life, I take my leave of thee!&mdash;<br />
These are two cupping-glasses that shall draw<br />
[<i>Showing the pistols.</i><br />
All my infected blood out. Are you ready?<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor. and Zanche.</i> Ready.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Flam.</i> Whither shall I go now? O Lucian, thy
ridiculous purgatory! to find Alexander the Great
cobbling shoes, Pompey tagging points, and Julius
Cæsar making hair-buttons! Hannibal selling blacking,
and Augustus crying garlic! Charlemagne selling
lists by the dozen, and King Pepin crying apples in
a cart drawn with one horse!<br />
Whether I resolve to fire, earth, water, air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span><br />
Or all the elements by scruples, I know not,<br />
Nor greatly care.&mdash;Shoot, shoot:<br />
Of all deaths the violent death is best;<br />
For from ourselves it steals ourselves so fast,<br />
The pain, once apprehended, is quite past.<br />
[<i>They shoot: he falls; and they run to him, and
tread upon him.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> What, are you dropt?<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> I am mixed with earth already: as you are noble,<br />
Perform your vows, and bravely follow me.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

That would have been my ruin.<br />

<p><i>Flam.</i> Will you be perjured? what a religious oath
was Styx, that the gods never durst swear by, and
violate! O, that we had such an oath to minister,
and to be so well kept in our courts of justice!</p>

Do run before thee to fetch fire from hell,<br />
To light thee thither.<br />
<br />

Most stinking soot! the chimney is a-fire:<br />
My liver's parboiled, like Scotch holly-bread;<br />
There's a plumber laying pipes in my guts, it scalds.&mdash;<br />
Wilt thou outlive me?<br />
<br />

Through thy body; for we'll give it out<br />

And doubled all your reaches.&mdash;I am not wounded;<br />

The pistols held no bullets: 'twas a plot<br />

<br />

Was the great Duke of Florence.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Flam.</i> You shall not take justice from forth my hands,&mdash;<br />
O, let me kill her!&mdash;I'll cut my safety<br />
Through your coats of steel. Fate's a spaniel,<br />
We cannot beat it from us. What remains now?<br />
Let all that do ill, take this precedent,&mdash;<br />
Man may his fate foresee, but not prevent:<br />
And of all axioms this shall win the prize,&mdash;<br />
'Tis better to be fortunate than wise.<br />

I have seen a blackbird that would sooner fly<br />
To a man's bosom, than to stay the gripe<br />
Of the fierce sparrowhawk.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span><br />

But death or punishment by the hands of others.<br />
<br />

Into the centre.<br />
<br />

Not like a noble fellow; for thou see'st<br />
I cannot strike again.<br />

<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Would'st have me die, as I was born, in whining?<br />
<br />
<i>Gas.</i> Recommend yourself to Heaven.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Lod.</i> O, could I kill you forty times a day,<br />
And use't four year together, 'twere too little!<br />
Naught grieves but that you are too few to feed<br />
The famine of our vengeance. What dost think on?<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Nothing; of nothing: leave thy idle questions.<br />
I am i' the way to study a long silence:<br />
To prate were idle. I remember nothing.<br />
There's nothing of so infinite vexation<br />
As man's own thoughts.<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> O thou glorious strumpet!<br />
Could I divide thy breath from this pure air<br />
When't leaves thy body, I would suck it up,<br />
And breathe't upon some dunghill.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> You, my death's-man!<br />
Methinks thou dost not look horrid enough,<br />
Thou hast too good a face to be a hangman:<br />
If thou be, do thy office in right form;<br />
Fall down upon thy knees, and ask forgiveness.<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> O, thou hast been a most prodigious comet<br />
But I'll cut off your train,&mdash;kill the Moor first.<br />

<i>Vit. Cor.</i> You shall not kill her first; behold my breast:<br />
I will be waited on in death; my servant<br />
Shall never go before me.<br />
<br />
<i>Gas.</i> Are you so brave?<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> Yes, I shall welcome death<br />
As princes do some great ambassadors;<br />
I'll meet thy weapon half way.<br />
<br />
<i>Lod.</i> Thou dost tremble:<br />
Methinks fear should dissolve thee into air.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> O, thou art deceived, I am too true a woman:<br />
Conceit can never kill me. I'll tell thee what,<br />
I will not in my death shed one base tear;<br />
Or if look pale, for want of blood, not fear.<br />
<br />
<i>Carlo.</i> Thou art my task, black Fury,<br />
<br />
<i>Zanche.</i> I have blood<br />
As red as either of theirs: wilt drink some?<br />
'Tis good for the falling-sickness. I am proud<br />
Death cannot alter my complexion,<br />
For I shall ne'er look pale.<br />
<br />

With a joint motion.<br />
[<i>They stab</i> <span class="smcap">Vittoria, Zanche</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Flamineo</span>.<br />

And then thou wilt be famous.<br />

A Toledo, or an English fox?<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a><br />
I ever thought a cutler should distinguish<br />
The cause of my death, rather than a doctor.<br />
Search my wound deeper; tent it with the steel<br />
That made it.<br />
<br />

Now my blood pays for't.<br />

I love thee now: if woman do breed man,<br />
She ought to teach him manhood: fare thee well.<br />
Know, many glorious women that are famed<br />
For masculine virtue have been vicious,<br />
Only a happier silence did betide them:<br />
She hath no faults who hath the art to hide them.<br />
<br />
<i>Vit. Cor.</i> My soul, like to a ship in a black storm,<br />
Is driven, I know not whither.<br />
<br />
<i>Flam.</i> Then cast anchor.<br />
Prosperity doth bewitch men, seeming clear;<br />
But seas do laugh, show white, when rocks are near.<br />
We cease to grieve, cease to be fortune's slaves,<br />
Nay, cease to die, by dying. Art thou gone?<br />
And thou so near the bottom? false report,<br />
Which says that women vie with the nine Muses<br />
For nine tough durable lives! I do not look<br />
Who went before, nor who shall follow me;<br />
No, at myself I will begin and end.<br />
While we look up to Heaven, we confound<br />
Knowledge with knowledge. O, I am in a mist!<br />

Nor ever knew great men but by report! [<i>Dies.</i><br />

And instantly go out.<br />
Let all that belong to great men remember the old
wives' tradition, to be like the lions i' the Tower, on
Candlemas-day: to mourn if the sun shine, for fear
of the pitiful remainder of winter to come.<br />
'Tis well yet there's some goodness in my death;<br />
My life was a black charnel. I have caught<br />
An everlasting cold; I have lost my voice<br />
Most irrecoverably. Farewell, glorious villains!<br />
This busy trade of life appears most vain,<br />
Since rest breeds rest, where all seek pain by pain.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>Let no harsh flattering bells resound my knell;<br />

Thy father chose his pensioner.<br />

Away with them to prison and to torture!<br />
All that have hands in this shall taste our justice,<br />
As I hope Heaven.<br />
<br />

That I can call this act mine own. For my part,<br />
The rack, the gallows, and the torturing wheel,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>Shall be but sound sleeps to me: here's my rest;<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster's tragedy of <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i>&mdash;"the
perfect and exact Copy, with
diverse things printed, that the length
of the Play would not bear in the
Presentment"&mdash;was printed in 1623,
having been acted by the King's servants
at Blackfriars and the Globe, Burbadge
playing the part of Ferdinand. It was printed again in
1640 and in 1678. Theobald published an adaptation of
it, called <i>The Fatal Secret</i>, in 1735. <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i>
was revived at the Haymarket in 1707, and again at
Sadler's Wells in 1850. Concerning its performance at
the latter theatre Professor Ward remarks, "I remember,
not many years ago, seeing <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> well acted
by Miss Glyn; the impression which the tragedy produces
on the stage is indescribable."</p>

<p>The story of this play is in the <i>Novelle</i> of Bendello,
Part I., N. 26. Through Belleforest's French version it
found its way into Paynter's <i>Palace of Pleasure</i>. Lope de
Vega in 1618 wrote <i>El Mayordomo de la Duquesa de Amalfi</i>.</p>

<p>My Noble Lord,</p>

<p>That I may present my excuse why,
being a stranger to your lordship, I
offer this poem to your patronage, I
plead this warrant:&mdash;men who never
saw the sea yet desire to behold that
regiment of waters, choose some
eminent river to guide them thither,
and make that, as it were, their conduct
or postilion: by the like ingenious means has your
fame arrived at my knowledge, receiving it from some of
worth, who both in contemplation and practice owe to
your honour their clearest service. I do not altogether
look up at your title; the ancientest nobility being but a
relic of time past, and the truest honour indeed being for
a map to confer honour on himself, which your learning
strives to propagate, and shall make you arrive at the
dignity of a great example. I am confident this work is
not unworthy your honour's perusal; for by such poems
as this poets have kissed the hands of great princes, and
drawn their gentle eyes to look down upon their sheets of
paper when the poets themselves were bound up in their
winding-sheets. The like courtesy from your lordship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
shall make you live in your grave, and laurel spring out of
it, when the ignorant scorners of the Muses, that like worms
in libraries seem to live only to destroy learning, shall wither
neglected and forgotten. This work and myself I humbly
present to your approved censure, it being the utmost of
my wishes to have your honourable self my weighty and
perspicuous comment; which grace so done me shall ever
be acknowledged</p>

<h2>THE DUCHESS OF MALFI.</h2>


<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>The Presence-chamber in the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess'</span>
<i>Palace at Malfi.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Delio</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Delio.</i> You are welcome to your country, dear Antonio;<br />
You have been long in France, and you return<br />
A very formal Frenchman in your habit:<br />
How do you like the French court?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I admire it:<br />
In seeking to reduce both state and people<br />
To a fixed order, their judicious king<br />
Begins at home; quits first his royal palace<br />
Of flattering sycophants, of dissolute<br />
And infamous persons,&mdash;which he sweetly terms<br />
His master's master-piece, the work of Heaven;<br />
Considering duly that a prince's court<br />
Is like a common fountain, whence should flow<br />
Pure silver drops in general, but if't chance<br />
Some cursed example poison't near the head,<br />
Death and diseases through the whole land spread.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>And what is't makes this blessèd government<br />
But a most provident council, who dare freely<br />
Inform him the corruption of the times?<br />
Though some o' the court hold it presumption<br />
To instruct princes what they ought to do,<br />
It is a noble duty to inform them<br />
What they ought to foresee.&mdash;Here comes Bosola,<br />
The only court-gall; yet I observe his railing<br />
Is not for simple love of piety:<br />
Indeed, he rails at those things which he wants;<br />
Would be as lecherous, covetous, or proud,<br />
Bloody, or envious, as any man,<br />
If he had means to be so.&mdash;Here's the cardinal.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter the</i> Cardinal <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bosola</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bos.</i> I do haunt you still.</p>

<p><i>Card.</i> So.</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> I have done you better service than to be
slighted thus. Miserable age, where only the reward
of doing well is the doing of it!</p>

<p><i>Card.</i> You enforce your merit too much.</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> I fell into the galleys in your service; where,
for two years together, I wore two towels instead of
a shirt, with a knot on the shoulder, after the fashion
of a Roman mantle. Slighted thus! I will thrive
some way: blackbirds fatten best in hard weather;
why not I in these dog-days?</p>

<p><i>Card.</i> Would you could become honest!</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> With all your divinity do but direct me the
way to it. I have known many travel far for it,
and yet return as arrant knaves as they went forth,
because they carried themselves always along with
them. [<i>Exit</i> Cardinal.] Are you gone? Some
fellows, they say, are possessed with the devil, but
this great fellow were able to possess the greatest
devil, and make him worse.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> He hath denied thee some suit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> He and his brother are like plum-trees that
grow crooked over standing-pools; they are rich and
o'er-laden with fruit, but none but crows, pies, and
caterpillars feed on them. Could I be one of their
flattering panders, I would hang on their ears like a
horseleech, till I were full, and then drop off. I pray,
leave me. Who would rely upon these miserable
dependancies, in expectation to be advanced to-morrow?
what creature ever fed worse than hoping
Tantalus? nor ever died any man more fearfully than
he that hoped for a pardon. There are rewards for
hawks and dogs when they have done us service;
but for a soldier that hazards his limbs in a battle,
nothing but a kind of geometry is his last supportation.</p>

<p><i>Delio.</i> Geometry!</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Ay, to hang in a fair pair of slings, take his
latter swing in the world upon an honourable pair
of crutches, from hospital to hospital. Fare ye well,
sir: and yet do not you scorn us; for places in the
court are but like beds in the hospital, where this
man's head lies at that man's foot, and so lower and
lower. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Delio.</i> I knew this fellow seven years in the galleys<br />
For a notorious murder; and 'twas thought<br />
The cardinal suborned it: he was released<br />
By the French general, Gaston de Foix,<br />
When he recovered Naples.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> 'Tis great pity<br />
He should be thus neglected: I have heard<br />
He's very valiant. This foul melancholy<br />
Will poison all his goodness; for, I'll tell you,<br />
If too immoderate sleep be truly said<br />
To be an inward rust unto the soul,<br />
It then doth follow want of action<br />
Breeds all black malcontents; and their close rearing,<br />
Like moths in cloth, do hurt for want of wearing.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span><br />
<i>Delio.</i> The presence 'gins to fill: you promised me<br />
To make me the partaker of the natures<br />
Of some of your great courtiers.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> The lord cardinal's,<br />
And other strangers' that are now in court?<br />
I shall.&mdash;Here comes the great Calabrian duke.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ferdinand, Castruccio, Silvio, Roderigo,
Grisolan</span>, <i>and</i> Attendants.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Who took the ring oftenest?<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p><i>Sil.</i> Antonio Bologna, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Our sister duchess' great-master of her
household? give him the jewel.&mdash;When shall we
leave this sportive action, and fall to action indeed?</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Methinks, my lord, you should not desire to
go to war in person.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Now for some gravity:&mdash;why, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> It is fitting a soldier arise to be a prince, but
not necessary a prince descend to be a captain.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> No?</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> No, my lord; he were far better do it by a
deputy.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Why should he not as well sleep or eat by
a deputy? this might take idle, offensive, and base
office from him, whereas the other deprives him of
honour.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Believe my experience, that realm is never
long in quiet where the ruler is a soldier.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Thou toldest me thy wife could not endure
fighting.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> True, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> And of a jest she broke of a captain she met
full of wounds: I have forgot it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> She told him, my lord, he was a pitiful fellow,
to lie, like the children of Ismael, all in tents.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Why, there's a wit were able to undo all the
surgeons o' the city; for although gallants should
quarrel, and had drawn their weapons, and were
ready to go to it, yet her persuasions would make
them put up.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> That she would, my lord.&mdash;How do you like
my Spanish gennet?</p>

<p><i>Rod.</i> He is all fire.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> I am of Pliny's opinion, I think he was
begot by the wind; he runs as if he were ballassed
with quicksilver.</p>

<p><i>Silvio.</i> True, my lord, he reels from the tilt often.</p>

<p><i>Rod. Gris.</i> Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Why do you laugh? methinks you that are
courtiers should be my touchwood, take fire when I
give fire; that is, laugh but when I laugh, were the
subject never so witty.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> True, my lord: I myself have heard a very
good jest, and have scorned to seem to have so silly
a wit as to understand it.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> But I can laugh at your fool, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> He cannot speak, you know, but he makes
faces: my lady cannot abide him.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> No?</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Nor endure to be in merry company; for
she says too much laughing, and too much company,
fills her too full of the wrinkle.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> I would, then, have a mathematical instrument
made for her face, that she might not laugh
out of compass.&mdash;I shall shortly visit you at Milan,
Lord Silvio.</p>

<p><i>Silvio.</i> Your grace shall arrive most welcome.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> You are a good horseman, Antonio: you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
have excellent riders in France: what do you think
of good horsemanship?</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Nobly, my lord: as out of the Grecian horse
issued many famous princes, so out of brave horsemanship
arise the first sparks of growing resolution,
that raise the mind to noble action.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> You have bespoke it worthily.</p>

<p><i>Silvio.</i> Your brother, the lord cardinal, and sister
duchess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Re-enter</i> Cardinal, <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess, Cariola</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Julia</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Card.</i> Are the galleys come about?</p>

<p><i>Gris.</i> They are, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Here's the Lord Silvio is come to take his leave.</p>

<p>
<i>Delio.</i> Now, sir, your promise; what's that cardinal?<br />
I mean his temper? they say he's a brave fellow,<br />
Will play his five thousand crowns at tennis, dance,<br />
Court ladies, and one that hath fought single combats.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Some such flashes superficially hang on him
for form; but observe his inward character: he is a
melancholy churchman; the spring in his face is
nothing but the engendering of toads; where he is
jealous of any man, he lays worse plots for them than
ever was imposed on Hercules, for he strews in his
way flatterers, panders, intelligencers, atheists, and
a thousand such political monsters. He should have
been Pope; but instead of coming to it by the
primitive decency of the church, he did bestow
bribes so largely and so impudently as if he would
have carried it away without Heaven's knowledge.
Some good he hath done&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>Delio.</i> You have given too much of him. What's his brother?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> The duke there? a most perverse and turbulent nature:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>What appears in him mirth is merely outside;<br />
If he laugh heartily, it is to laugh<br />
All honesty out of fashion.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Twins?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> In quality.<br />
He speaks with others' tongues, and hears men's suits<br />
With others' ears; will seem to sleep o' the bench<br />
Only to entrap offenders in their answers;<br />
Dooms men to death by information;<br />
Rewards by hearsay.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Then the law to him<br />
Is like a foul black cobweb to a spider,&mdash;<br />
He makes it his dwelling and a prison<br />
To entangle those shall feed him.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Most true:<br />
He never pays debts unless they be shrewd turns,<br />
And those he will confess that he doth owe.<br />
Last, for his brother there, the cardinal,<br />
They that do flatter him most say oracles<br />
Hang at his lips; and verily I believe them,<br />
For the devil speaks in them.<br />
But for their sister, the right noble duchess,<br />
You never fixed your eye on three fair medals<br />
Cast in one figure, of so different temper.<br />
For her discourse, it is so full of rapture,<br />
You only will begin then to be sorry<br />
When she doth end her speech, and wish, in wonder,<br />
She held it less vain-glory to talk much,<br />
Than your penance to hear her: whilst she speaks,<br />
She throws upon a man so sweet a look,<br />
That it were able to raise one to a galliard<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><br />
That lay in a dead palsy, and to dote<br />
On that sweet countenance; but in that look<br />
There speaketh so divine a continence<br />
As cuts off all lascivious and vain hope.<br />
Her days are practised in such noble virtue,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>That sure her nights, nay, more, her very sleeps,<br />
Are more in Heaven than other ladies' shrifts.<br />
Let all sweet ladies break their flattering glasses,<br />
And dress themselves in her.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Fie, Antonio,<br />
You play the wire-drawer with her commendations.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I'll case the picture up: only thus much;<br />
All her particular worth grows to this sum,&mdash;<br />
She stains the time past, lights the time to come.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> You must attend my lady in the gallery,<br />
Some half an hour hence.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I shall. [<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Delio</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Sister, I have a suit to you.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> To me, sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> A gentleman here, Daniel de Bosola,<br />
One that was in the galleys&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Yes, I know him.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> A worthy fellow he is: pray, let me entreat for<br />
The provisorship of your horse.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Your knowledge of him<br />
Commends him and prefers him.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Call him hither. [<i>Exit</i> Attendant.<br />
We are now upon parting. Good Lord Silvio,<br />
Do us commend to all our noble friends<br />
At the leaguer.<br />
<br />
<i>Silvio.</i> Sir, I shall.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> You are for Milan?<br />
<br />
<i>Silvio.</i> I am.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Bring the caroches.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> We'll bring you down to the haven.<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess, Silvio, Castruccio, Roderigo,
Grisolan, Cariola, Julia</span>, <i>and</i> Attendants.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> Be sure you entertain that Bosola<br />
For your intelligence: I would not be seen in't;<br />
And therefore many times I have slighted him<br />
When he did court our furtherance, as this morning.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span><br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Antonio, the great-master of her household,<br />
Had been far fitter.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> You are deceived in him:<br />
His nature is too honest for such business.&mdash;<br />
He comes: I'll leave you. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bosola</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Bos.</i> I was lured to you.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> My brother, here, the cardinal could never<br />
Abide you.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Never since he was in my debt.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> May be some oblique character in your face<br />
Made him suspect you.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Doth he study physiognomy?<br />
There's no more credit to be given to the face<br />
Than to a sick man's urine, which some call<br />
The physician's whore because she cozens him.<br />
He did suspect me wrongfully.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> For that<br />
You must give great men leave to take their times.<br />
Distrust doth cause us seldom be deceived:<br />
You see the oft shaking of the cedar-tree<br />
Fastens it more at root.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Yet, take heed;<br />
For to suspect a friend unworthily<br />
Instructs him the next way to suspect you,<br />
And prompts him to deceive you.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> There's gold.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> So:<br />
What follows? never rained such showers as these<br />
Without thunderbolts i' the tail of them: whose throat must I cut?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Your inclination to shed blood rides post<br />
Before my occasion to use you. I give you that<br />
To live i' the court here, and observe the duchess;<br />
To note all the particulars of her haviour,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>What suitors do solicit her for marriage,<br />
And whom she best affects. She's a young widow:<br />
I would not have her marry again.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> No, sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Do not you ask the reason; but be satisfied<br />
I say I would not.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> It seems you would create me<br />
One of your familiars.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Familiar! what's that?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Why, a very quaint invisible devil in flesh,<br />
An intelligencer.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Such a kind of thriving thing<br />
I would wish thee; and ere long thou mayest arrive<br />
At a higher place by't.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Take your devils,<br />
Which hell calls angels; these cursed gifts would make<br />
You a corrupter, me an impudent traitor;<br />
And should I take these, they'd take me to hell.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Sir, I'll take nothing from you that I have given:<br />
There is a place that I procured for you<br />
This morning, the provisorship o' the horse;<br />
Have you heard on't?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> No.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> 'Tis yours: is't not worth thanks?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> I would have you curse yourself now, that your bounty<br />
(Which makes men truly noble) e'er should make me<br />
A villain. O, that to avoid ingratitude<br />
For the good deed you have done me, I must do<br />
All the ill man can invent! Thus the devil<br />
Candies all sins o'er; and what Heaven terms vile,<br />
That names he complimental.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a><br />

Keep your old garb of melancholy; 'twill express<br />

Yet strive not to come near 'em: this will gain<br />
Access to private lodgings, where yourself<br />
May, like a politic dormouse&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> As I have seen some<br />
Feed in a lord's dish, half asleep, not seeming<br />
To listen to any talk; and yet these rogues<br />
Have cut his throat in a dream. What's my place?<br />
The provisorship o' the horse? say, then, my corruption<br />
Grew out of horse-dung: I am your creature.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Away!<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Let good men, for good deeds, covet good fame,<br />
Since place and riches oft are bribes of shame:<br />
Sometimes the devil doth preach. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<i>Duch.</i> I think this speech between you both was studied,<br />
It came so roundly off.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> You are my sister;<br />
This was my father's poinard, do you see?<br />
I'd be loth to see't look rusty, 'cause 'twas his.<br />

A visor and a mask are whispering-rooms<br />

<br />

What takes that from him? only the bare name<br />
Of being a father, or the weak delight<br />
To see the little wanton ride a-cock-horse<br />
Upon a painted stick, or hear him chatter<br />
Like a taught starling.<br />

May do it: thus; is it fit?<br />
[<i>She puts the ring upon his finger: he kneels.</i><br />

<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Sir,<br />
This goodly roof of yours is too low built;<br />
I cannot stand upright in't nor discourse,<br />
Without I raise it higher: raise yourself;<br />
Or, if you please, my hand to help you: so.<br />
[<i>Raises him.</i><br />

If you will know where breathes a complete man<br />

And ne'er ta'en wages of her.<br />

The misery of us that are born great!<br />
We are forced to woo, because none dare woo us;<br />
And as a tyrant doubles with his words,<br />
And fearfully equivocates, so we<br />
Are forced to express our violent passions<br />
In riddles and in dreams, and leave the path<br />
Of simple virtue, which was never made<br />
To seem the thing it is not. Go, go brag<br />
You have left me heartless; mine is in your bosom:<br />
I hope 'twill multiply love there. You do tremble:<br />
Make not your heart so dead a piece of flesh,<br />
To fear more than to love me. Sir, be confident:<br />
What is't distracts you? This is flesh and blood, sir;<br />
'Tis not the figure cut in alabaster<br />
Kneels at my husband's tomb. Awake, awake, man!<br />
I do here put off all vain ceremony,<br />
And only do appear to you a young widow<br />
That claims you for her husband, and, like a widow,<br />
I use but half a blush in't.<br />

I will remain the constant sanctuary<br />

As fearful to devour them too soon.<br />

<i>Ant.</i> But for your brothers?<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Do not think of them:<br />
All discord without this circumference<br />
Is only to be pitied, and not feared:<br />
Yet, should they know it, time will easily<br />
Scatter the tempest.<br />

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>An Apartment in the Palace of the</i>
<span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bosola</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Castruccio</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Bos.</i> You say you would fain be taken for an eminent courtier?<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> 'Tis the very main of my ambition.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Let me see: you have a
reasonable good face for't already,
and your night-cap expresses your
ears sufficient largely. I would have you learn
to twirl the strings of your band with a good
grace, and in a set speech, at the end of every
sentence, to hum three or four times, or blow your
nose till it smart again, to recover your memory.
When you come to be a president in criminal causes,
if you smile upon a prisoner, hang him; but if you
frown upon him and threaten him, let him be sure
to scape the gallows.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> I would be a very merry president.</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Do not sup o' nights; 'twill beget you an
admirable wit.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Rather it would make me have a good
stomach to quarrel; for they say, your roaring
boys<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> eat meat seldom, and that makes them so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
valiant. But how shall I know whether the people
take me for an eminent fellow?</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> I will teach a trick to know it: give out you
lie a-dying, and if you hear the common people
curse you, be sure you are taken for one of the
prime night-caps.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter an</i> Old Lady.</p></blockquote>

<p>You come from painting now.</p>

<p><i>Old Lady.</i> From what?</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Why, from your scurvy face-physic. To
behold thee not painted inclines somewhat near a
miracle; these in thy face here were deep ruts and
foul sloughs the last progress.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> There was a lady
in France that, having had the small-pox, flayed the
skin off her face to make it more level; and whereas
before she looked like a nutmeg-grater, after she
resembled an abortive hedgehog.</p>

<p><i>Old Lady.</i> Do you call this painting?</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> No, no, but you call it careening of an old
morphewed<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> lady, to make her disembogue again:
there's rough-cast phrase to your plastic.</p>

<p><i>Old Lady.</i> It seems you are well acquainted with
my closet.</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> One would suspect it for a shop of witchcraft,
to find in it the fat of serpents, spawn of snakes,
Jews' spittle, and their young children's ordure; and
all these for the face. I would sooner eat a dead
pigeon taken from the soles of the feet of one sick of
the plague than kiss one of you fasting. Here are
two of you, whose sin of your youth is the very patrimony
of the physician; makes him renew his foot-cloth<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
with the spring, and change his high-priced
courtezan with the fall of the leaf. I do wonder you do
not loathe yourselves. Observe my meditation now.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>What thing is in this outward form of man<br />
To be beloved? We account it ominous,<br />
If nature do produce a colt, or lamb,<br />
A fawn, or goat, in any limb resembling<br />
A man, and fly from't as a prodigy:<br />
Man stands amazed to see his deformity<br />
In any other creature but himself.<br />
But in our own flesh, though we bear diseases<br />
Which have their true names only ta'en from beasts,&mdash;<br />
As the most ulcerous wolf and swinish measle,&mdash;<br />
Though we are eaten up of lice and worms,<br />
And though continually we bear about us<br />
A rotten and dead body, we delight<br />
To hide it in rich tissue: all our fear,<br />
Nay, all our terror, is lest our physician<br />
Should put us in the ground to be made sweet.&mdash;<br />
Your wife's gone to Rome: you two couple, and get
you to the wells at Lucca to recover your aches. I
have other work on foot.
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Castruccio</span> <i>and</i> Old Lady.<br />
I observe our duchess<br />
Is sick a-days, she pukes, her stomach seethes,<br />
The fins of her eye-lids looks most teeming blue,<br />
She wanes i' the cheek, and waxes fat i' the flank,<br />
And, contrary to our Italian fashion,<br />
Wears a loose-bodied gown: there's somewhat in't.<br />
I have a trick may chance discover it,<br />
A pretty one; I have bought some apricocks,<br />
The first our spring yields.<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Delio</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Delio.</i> And so long since married!<br />
You amaze me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Let me seal your lips for ever:<br />
For, did I think that any thing but the air<br />
Could carry these words from you, I should wish<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>You had no breath at all.&mdash;Now, sir, in your contemplation?<br />
You are studying to become a great wise fellow.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> O, sir, the opinion of wisdom is a foul tether
that runs all over a man's body: if simplicity direct
us to have no evil, it directs us to a happy being;
for the subtlest folly proceeds from the subtlest
wisdom: let me be simply honest.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> I do understand your inside.</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Do you so?</p>

<p>
<i>Ant.</i> Because you would not seem to appear to the world<br />
Puffed up with your preferment, you continue<br />
This out-of-fashion melancholy: leave it, leave it.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Give me leave to be honest in any phrase, in
any compliment whatsoever. Shall I confess myself
to you? I look no higher than I can reach: they
are the gods that must ride on winged horses. A
lawyer's mule of a slow pace will both suit my disposition
and business; for, mark me, when a man's
mind rides faster than his horse can gallop, they
quickly both tire.</p>

<p>
<i>Ant.</i> You would look up to Heaven, but I think<br />
The devil, that rules i' the air, stands in your light.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> O, sir, you are lord of the ascendant, chief
man with the duchess; a duke was your cousin-german
removed. Say you are lineally descended
from King Pepin, or he himself, what of this? search
the heads of the greatest rivers in the world, you shall
find them but bubbles of water. Some would think
the souls of princes were brought forth by some
more weighty cause than those of meaner persons:
they are deceived, there's the same hand to them;
the like passions sway them; the same reason that
makes a vicar to go to law for a tithe-pig, and undo
his neighbours, makes them spoil a whole province,
and batter down goodly cities with the cannon.</p>

<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Yes.<br />
<br />

'Tis ceremony more than duty that consists<br />
In the removing of a piece of felt:<br />
Be you the example to the rest o' the court;<br />
Put on your hat first.<br />
<br />

I have seen, in colder countries than in France,<br />
Nobles stand bare to the prince; and the distinction<br />
Methought showed reverently.<br />

<i>Duch.</i> This green fruit and my stomach are not friends:<br />
How they swell me!<br />
<br />

<br />

<p>
<i>Ant.</i> O my most trusty Delio, we are lost!<br />
I fear she's fall'n in labour; and there's left<br />
No time for her remove.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Have you prepared<br />
Those ladies to attend her? and procured<br />
That politic safe conveyance for the midwife<br />
Your duchess plotted?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I have.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Make use, then, of this forced occasion:<br />
Give out that Bosola hath poisoned her<br />
With these apricocks; that will give some colour<br />
For her keeping close.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Fie, fie, the physicians<br />
Will then flock to her.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> For that you may pretend<br />
She'll use some prepared antidote of her own,<br />
Lest the physicians should re-poison her.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I am lost in amazement: I know not what to think on't.<br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>A Hall in the same Palace.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bosola</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bos.</i> So, so, there's no question but her techiness
and most vulturous eating of the apricocks are
apparent signs of breeding.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter an</i> Old Lady.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now?</p>

<p><i>Old Lady.</i> I am in haste, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> There was a young waiting-woman had a
monstrous desire to see the glass-house&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old Lady.</i> Nay, pray let me go.</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> And it was only to know what strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>instrument it was should swell up a glass to the
fashion of a woman's belly.</p>

<p><i>Old Lady.</i> I will hear no more of the glass-house.
You are still abusing women?</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Who, I? no; only, by the way now and
then, mention your frailties. The orange-tree bears
ripe and green fruit and blossoms all together; and
some of you give entertainment for pure love, but
more for more precious reward. The lusty spring
smells well; but drooping autumn tastes well. If we
have the same golden showers that rained in the time
of Jupiter the thunderer, you have the same Danäes
still, to hold up their laps to receive them. Didst
thou never study the mathematics?</p>

<p><i>Old Lady.</i> What's that, sir?</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Why to know the trick how to make a many
lines meet in one centre. Go, go, give your foster-daughters
good counsel: tell them, that the devil
takes delight to hang at a woman's girdle, like a false
rusty watch, that she cannot discern how the time
passes. [<i>Exit</i> Old Lady.</p>

All the officers o' the court.<br />

<p><i>2nd Serv.</i> A Switzer!</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>1st Serv.</i> The cod-piece was the case for't.</p>

<p><i>2nd Serv.</i> There was a cunning traitor: who
would have searched his cod-piece?</p>

<p><i>1st Serv.</i> True, if he had kept out of the ladies'
chambers: and all the moulds of his buttons were
leaden bullets.</p>

<p><i>2nd Serv.</i> O wicked cannibal! a fire-lock in's cod-piece!</p>

<p><i>1st Serv.</i> 'Twas a French plot, upon my life.</p>

<p><i>Servants.</i> We are.</p>

<p>

We have lost much plate you know; and but this evening<br />
Jewels, to the value of four thousand ducats,<br />
Are missing in the duchess' cabinet.<br />
Are the gates shut?<br />

<br />
<i>Ant.</i> 'Tis the duchess' pleasure<br />
Each officer be locked into his chamber<br />
Till the sun-rising; and to send the keys<br />
Of all their chests and of their outward doors<br />
Into her bed-chamber. She is very sick.<br />

Unto the worst of torture, pain and fear.<br />
<br />

You are this night, dear friend, to post to Rome:<br />
My life lies in your service.<br />

<br />

Somewhat that looks like danger.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Believe it,<br />
'Tis but the shadow of your fear, no more:<br />
How superstitiously we mind our evils!<br />
The throwing down salt, or crossing of a hare.<br />
Bleeding at nose, the stumbling of a horse,<br />
Or singing of a cricket, are of power<br />
To daunt whole man in us. Sir, fare you well:<br />
I wish you all the joys of a blessed father:<br />
And, for my faith, lay this unto your breast,&mdash;<br />
Old friends, like old swords, still are trusted best. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<p>
<i>Bos.</i> Sure I did hear a woman shriek: list, ha!<br />
And the sound came, if I received it right,<br />
From the duchess' lodgings. There's some stratagem<br />
In the confining all our courtiers<br />
To their several wards: I must have part of it;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>My intelligence will freeze else. List, again!<br />
It may be 'twas the melancholy bird,<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Ant.</i> I heard some noise.&mdash;Who's there? what art thou? speak.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Antonio, put not your face nor body<br />
To such a forced expression of fear:<br />
I am Bosola, your friend.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Bosola!&mdash;<br />
[<i>Aside.</i>] This mole does undermine me.&mdash;Heard you not<br />
A noise even now?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> From whence?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> From the duchess' lodging.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Not I: did you?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I did, or else I dreamed.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Let's walk towards it.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> No: it may be 'twas<br />
But the rising of the wind.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Very likely.<br />
Methinks 'tis very cold, and yet you sweat:<br />
You look wildly.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I have been setting a figure<br />
For the duchess' jewels.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Ah, and how falls your question?<br />
Do you find it radical?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> What's that to you?<br />
'Tis rather to be questioned what design,<br />
When all men were commanded to their lodgings,<br />
Makes you a night-walker.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> In sooth, I'll tell you:<br />
Now all the court's asleep, I thought the devil<br />
Had least to do here; I came to say my prayers;<br />
And if it do offend you I do so,<br />
You are a fine courtier.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span><br />
<i>Ant.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] This fellow will undo me.&mdash;<br />
You gave the duchess apricocks to-day:<br />
Pray Heaven they were not poisoned!<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Poisoned! A Spanish fig<br />
For the imputation.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Traitors are ever confident<br />
Till they are discovered. There were jewels stol'n too:<br />
In my conceit, none are to be suspected<br />
More than yourself.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> You are a false steward.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Saucy slave, I'll pull thee up by the roots.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> May be the ruin will crush you to pieces.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> You are an impudent snake indeed, sir:<br />
Are you scarce warm, and do you show your sting?<br />
You libel well, sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> No, sir: copy it out,<br />
And I will set my hand to't.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] My nose bleeds.<br />
One that were superstitious would count<br />
This ominous, when it merely comes by chance:<br />
Two letters, that are wrote here for my name,<br />
Are drowned in blood!<br />
Mere accident.&mdash;For you, sir, I'll take order<br />
I' the morn you shall be safe:&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] 'tis that must colour<br />
Her lying-in:&mdash;sir, this door you pass not:<br />
I do not hold it fit that you come near<br />
The duchess' lodgings, till you have quit yourself.&mdash;<br />
[<i>Aside</i>] The great are like the base, nay, they are the same,<br />
When they seek shameful ways to avoid shame. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Antonio hereabout did drop a paper:&mdash;<br />
Some of your help, false friend:&mdash;O, here it is.<br />
What's here? a child's nativity calculated! [<i>Reads.</i><br />
"The duchess was delivered of a son, 'tween the

ascendant, signifies short life; and Mars being in a
human sign, joined to the tail of the Dragon, in the
eighth house, doth threaten a violent death. <i>Cætera

Why, now 'tis most apparent: this precise fellow<br />
Is the duchess' bawd:&mdash;I have it to my wish!<br />
This is a parcel of intelligency<br />
Our courtiers were cased up for: it needs must follow<br />
That I must be committed on pretence<br />
Of poisoning her; which I'll endure, and laugh at.<br />
If one could find the father now! but that<br />
Time will discover. Old Castruccio<br />
I' the morning posts to Rome: by him I'll send<br />
A letter that shall make her brothers' galls<br />
O'erflow their livers. This was a thrifty way.<br />
Though lust do mask in ne'er so strange disguise,<br />
She's oft found witty, but is never wise. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<p>
<i>Card.</i> Sit: thou art my best of wishes. Prithee, tell me<br />
What trick didst thou invent to come to Rome<br />
Without thy husband.<br />
<br />
<i>Julia.</i> Why, my lord, I told him<br />
I came to visit an old anchorite<br />
Here for devotion.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> Thou art a witty false one,&mdash;<br />
I mean, to him.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span><br />
<i>Julia.</i> You have prevailed with me<br />
Beyond my strongest thoughts: I would not now<br />
Find you inconstant.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> Do not put thyself<br />
To such a voluntary torture, which proceeds<br />
Out of your own guilt.<br />
<br />
<i>Julia.</i> How, my lord!<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> You fear<br />
My constancy, because you have approved<br />
Those giddy and wild turnings in yourself.<br />
<br />
<i>Julia.</i> Did you e'er find them?<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> Sooth, generally for women,<br />
A man might strive to make glass malleable,<br />
Ere he should make them fixèd.<br />
<br />
<i>Julia.</i> So, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> We had need go borrow that fantastic glass<br />
Invented by Galileo the Florentine<br />
To view another spacious world i' the moon,<br />
And look to find a constant woman there.<br />
<br />
<i>Julia.</i> This is very well, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> Why do you weep?<br />
Are tears your justification? the self-same tears<br />
Will fall into your husband's bosom, lady,<br />
With a loud protestation that you love him<br />
Above the world. Come, I'll love you wisely,<br />
That's jealously; since I am very certain<br />
You cannot make me cuckold.<br />
<br />
<i>Julia.</i> I'll go home<br />
To my husband.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> You may thank me, lady,<br />
I have taken you off your melancholy perch,<br />
Bore you upon my fist, and showed you game,<br />
And let you fly at it.&mdash;I pray thee, kiss me.&mdash;<br />
When thou wast with thy husband, thou wast watched<br />
Like a tame elephant:&mdash;still you are to thank me:&mdash;<br />
Thou hadst only kisses from him and high feeding;<br />
But what delight was that? 'twas just like one<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>That hath a little fingering on the lute,<br />
Yet cannot tune it:&mdash;still you are to thank me.<br />
<br />

And a sick liver, when you wooed me first,<br />
And spake like one in physic.<br />

Do not keep lodging for ladies.<br />

I have brought you no commendations from your husband,<br />
For I know none by him.<br />
<br />

Rogues do not whisper't now, but seek to publish't<br />
(As servants do the bounty of their lords)<br />
Aloud; and with a covetous searching eye,<br />
To mark who note them. O, confusion seize her!<br />
She hath had most cunning bawds to serve her turn,<br />
And more secure conveyances for lust<br />

Till of her bleeding heart I make a sponge<br />
To wipe it out.<br />
<br />

So wild a tempest?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Would I could be one,<br />
That I might toss her palace 'bout her ears,<br />
Root up her goodly forests, blast her meads,<br />
And lay her general territory as waste<br />
As she hath done her honours.<br />
<br />

Be thus attainted?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Apply desperate physic:<br />
We must not now use balsamum, but fire,<br />
The smarting cupping-glass, for that's the mean<br />
To purge infected blood, such blood as hers.<br />
There is a kind of pity in mine eye,&mdash;<br />
I'll give it to my handkercher; and now 'tis here,<br />
I'll bequeath this to her bastard.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> What to do?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Why, to make soft lint for his mother's wounds,<br />
When I have hewed her to pieces.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> Cursèd creature!<br />
Unequal nature, to place women's hearts<br />
So far upon the left side!<br />
<br />

That e'er will trust their honour in a bark<br />
Made of so slight weak bulrush as is woman,<br />
Apt every minute to sink it!<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> Thus<br />
Ignorance, when it hath purchased honour,<br />
It cannot wield it.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Methinks I see her laughing&mdash;<br />
Excellent hyena! Talk to me somewhat quickly,<br />
Or my imagination will carry me<br />
To see her in the shameful act of sin.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> With whom?<br />
<br />

Or one o' the woodyard that can quoit the sledge<br />
Or toss the bar, or else some lovely squire<br />
That carries coals up to her privy lodgings.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Go to, mistress!<br />
'Tis not your whore's milk that shall quench my wild fire,<br />
But your whore's blood.<br />

As men conveyed by witches through the air,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>On violent whirlwinds! this intemperate noise<br />

My palsy?<br />
<br />

Without this rupture:<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> there is not in nature<br />
A thing that makes man so deformed, so beastly,<br />
As doth intemperate anger. Chide yourself.<br />
You have divers men who never yet expressed<br />
Their strong desire of rest but by unrest,<br />
By vexing of themselves. Come, put yourself<br />
In tune.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> So I will only study to seem<br />
The thing I am not. I could kill her now,<br />
In you, or in myself; for I do think<br />
It is some sin in us Heaven doth revenge<br />
By her.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> Are you stark mad?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> I would have their bodies<br />
Burnt in a coal-pit with the ventage stopped,<br />
That their cursed smoke might not ascend to Heaven;<br />
Or dip the sheets they lie in in pitch or sulphur,<br />
Wrap them in't, and then light them like a match;<br />
Or else to boil their bastard to a cullis,<br />
And give't his lecherous father to renew<br />
The sin of his back.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> I'll leave you.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Nay, I have done.<br />
I am confident, had I been damned in hell,<br />
And should have heard of this, it would have put me<br />
Into a cold sweat. In, in; I'll go sleep.<br />
Till I know who leaps my sister, I'll not stir:<br />
That known, I'll find scorpions to string my whips,<br />
And fix her in a general eclipse. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

<h3>ACT THE THIRD.</h3>

<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>An Apartment in the Palace of the</i>
<span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Delio</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Ant.</i> Our noble friend, my most belovèd Delio!<br />
O, you have been a stranger long at court;<br />
Came you along with the Lord Ferdinand?<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> I did, sir: and how fares your noble duchess?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Right fortunately well: she's an excellent<br />
Feeder of pedigrees; since you last saw her,<br />
She hath had two children more, a son and daughter.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Methinks 'twas yesterday: let me but wink,<br />
And not behold your face, which to mine eye<br />
Is somewhat leaner, verily I should dream<br />
It were within this half hour.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> You have not been in law, friend Delio,<br />
Nor in prison, nor a suitor at the court,<br />
Nor begged the reversion of some great man's place,<br />
Nor troubled with an old wife, which doth make<br />
Your time so insensibly hasten.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Pray, sir, tell me,<br />
Hath not this news arrived yet to the ear<br />
Of the lord cardinal?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span><br />
<i>Ant.</i> I fear it hath:<br />
The Lord Ferdinand, that's newly come to court,<br />
Doth bear himself right dangerously.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Pray, why?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> He is so quiet that he seems to sleep<br />
The tempest out, as dormice do in winter:<br />
Those houses that are haunted are most still<br />
Till the devil be up.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> What say the common people?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> The common rabble do directly say<br />
She is a strumpet.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> And your graver heads<br />
Which would be politic, what censure they?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> They do observe I grow to infinite purchase,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a><br />
The left hand way, and all suppose the duchess<br />
Would amend it, if she could; for, say they,<br />
Great princes, though they grudge their officers<br />
Should have such large and unconfinèd means<br />
To get wealth under them, will not complain,<br />
Lest thereby they should make them odious<br />
Unto the people; for other obligation<br />
Of love or marriage between her and me<br />
They never dream of.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> The Lord Ferdinand<br />
Is going to bed.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess, Ferdinand</span>, <i>and</i> Attendants.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Ferd.</i> I'll instantly to bed,<br />
For I am weary.&mdash;I am to bespeak<br />
A husband for you.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> For me, sir! pray, who is't?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> The great Count Malatesti.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Fie upon him!<br />
A count! he's a mere stick of sugar-candy;<br />
You may look quite through him. When I choose<br />
A husband, I will marry for your honour.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span><br />
<i>Ferd.</i> You shall do well in't.&mdash;How is't, worthy Antonio?<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> But, sir, I am to have private conference with you<br />
About a scandalous report is spread<br />
Touching mine honour.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Let me be ever deaf to't:<br />
One of Pasquil's paper bullets, court-calumny,<br />
A pestilent air, which princes' palaces<br />
Are seldom purged of. Yet say that it were true,<br />
I pour it in your bosom, my fixed love<br />
Would strongly excuse, extenuate, nay, deny<br />
Faults, were they apparent in you. Go, be safe<br />
In your own innocency.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] O blessed comfort!<br />
This deadly air is purged.<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess, Antonio, Delio</span>, <i>and</i> Attendants.</p>

<p>
<i>Ferd.</i> Her guilt treads on<br />
Hot-burning coulters.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bosola</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Now, Bosola,</span><br />
How thrives our intelligence?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Sir, uncertainly:<br />
'Tis rumoured she hath had three bastards, but<br />
By whom we may go read i' the stars.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Why, some<br />
Hold opinion all things are written there.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Yes, if we could find spectacles to read them.<br />
I do suspect there hath been some sorcery<br />
Used on the duchess.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Sorcery! to what purpose?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> To make her dote on some desertless fellow<br />
She shames to acknowledge.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Can your faith give way<br />
To think there's power in potions or in charms,<br />
To make us love whether we will or no?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Most certainly.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span><br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Away! these are mere gulleries, horrid things,<br />
Invented by some cheating mountebanks<br />
To abuse us. Do you think that herbs or charms<br />
Can force the will? Some trials have been made<br />
In this foolish practice, but the ingredients<br />
Were lenitive poisons, such as are of force<br />
To make the patient mad; and straight the witch<br />
Swears by equivocation they are in love.<br />
The witchcraft lies in her rank blood. This night<br />
I will force confession from her. You told me<br />
You had got, within these two days, a false key<br />
Into her bed-chamber.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> I have.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> As I would wish.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> What do you intend to do?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Can you guess?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> No.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Do not ask, then:<br />
He that can compass me, and know my drifts,<br />
May say he hath put a girdle 'bout the world,<br />
And sounded all her quicksands.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> I do not<br />
Think so.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> What do you think, then, pray?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> That you are<br />
Your own chronicle too much, and grossly<br />
Flatter yourself.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Give me thy hand; I thank thee:<br />
I never gave pension but to flatterers,<br />
Till I entertainèd thee. Farewell.<br />
That friend a great man's ruin strongly checks,<br />
Who rails into his belief all his defects. [<i>Exeunt</i>.<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess, Antonio,</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Cariola</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Duch.</i> Bring me the casket hither, and the glass.&mdash;<br />
You get no lodging here to-night, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Indeed, I must persuade one.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Very good:<br />
I hope in time 'twill grow into a custom,<br />
That noblemen shall come with cap and knee<br />
To purchase a night's lodging of their wives.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I must lie here.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Must! you are lord of mis-rule.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Indeed, my rule is only in the night.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> To what use will you put me?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> We'll sleep together.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Alas,<br />
What pleasure can two lovers find in sleep!<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> My lord, I lie with her often; and I know<br />
She'll much disquiet you.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> See, you are complained of.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> For she's the sprawling'st bedfellow.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I shall like her the better for that.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Sir, shall I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Ay, pray thee, Cariola.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Wherefore still, when you lie with my lady,<br />
Do you rise so early?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Labouring men<br />
Count the clock oftenest, Cariola,<br />
Are glad when their task's ended.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> I'll stop your mouth. [<i>Kisses him.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Nay, that's but one; Venus had two soft doves<br />
To draw her chariot; I must have another&mdash;<br />
[<i>She kisses him again.</i><br />
When wilt thou marry, Cariola?<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> Never, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> O, fie upon this single life! forego it.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>We read how Daphne, for her peevish<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> flight,<br />
Became a fruitless bay-tree; Syrinx turned<br />
To the pale empty reed; Anaxarete<br />
Was frozen into marble: whereas those<br />
Which married, or proved kind unto their friends,<br />
Were by a gracious influence transhaped<br />
Into the olive, pomegranate, mulberry,<br />
Became flowers, precious stones, or eminent stars.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> This is a vain poetry: but I pray you tell me,<br />
If there were proposed me, wisdom, riches, and beauty,<br />
In three several young men, which should I choose.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> 'Tis a hard question: this was Paris' case,<br />
And he was blind in't, and there was great cause;<br />
For how was't possible he could judge right,<br />
Having three amorous goddesses in view,<br />
And they stark naked? 'twas a motion<br />
Were able to benight the apprehension<br />
Of the severest counsellor of Europe.<br />
Now I look on both your faces so well formed,<br />
It puts me in mind of a question I would ask.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> What is't?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I do wonder why hard-favoured ladies,<br />
For the most part, keep worse-favoured waiting-women<br />
To attend them, and cannot endure fair ones.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> O, that's soon answered.<br />
Did you ever in your life know an ill painter<br />
Desire to have his dwelling next door to the shop<br />
Of an excellent picture-maker? 'twould disgrace<br />
His face-making, and undo him. I prithee,<br />
When were we so merry?&mdash;My hair tangles.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Pray thee, Cariola, let's steal forth the room,<br />
And let her talk to herself: I have divers times<br />
Served her the like, when she hath chafed extremely.<br />
I love to see her angry. Softly, Cariola.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span><br />
<i>Duch.</i> Doth not the colour of my hair 'gin to change?<br />
When I wax gray, I shall have all the court<br />
Powder their hair with arras,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> to be like me.<br />

Before you would vouchsafe to call for the keys.<br />

<p>
We shall one day have my brothers take you napping;<br />
Methinks his presence, being now in court,<br />
Should make you keep your own bed; but you'll say<br />
Love mixed with fear is sweetest. I'll assure you,<br />
You shall get no more children till my brothers<br />
Consent to be your gossips. Have you lost your tongue?<br />
'Tis welcome:<br />
For know, whether I am doomed to live or die,<br />
I can do both like a prince.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Die, then, quickly! [<i>Giving her a poniard.</i><br />
Virtue, where art thou hid? what hideous thing<br />
Is it that doth eclipse thee?<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Pray, sir, hear me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Or is it true thou art but a bare name,<br />
And no essential thing?<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Sir,&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Do not speak.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> No, sir:<br />
I will plant my soul in mine ears, to hear you.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> O most imperfect light of human reason,<br />
That mak'st us so unhappy to foresee<br />
What we can least prevent! Pursue thy wishes,<br />
And glory in them: there's in shame no comfort<br />
But to be past all bounds and sense of shame.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> I pray, sir, hear me: I am married.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> So!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span><br />
<i>Duch.</i> Happily, not to your liking: but for that,<br />
Alas, your shears do come untimely now<br />
To clip the bird's wing that's already flown!<br />
Will you see my husband?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Yes, if I could change<br />
Eyes with a basilisk.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Sure, you came hither<br />
By his confederacy.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> The howling of a wolf<br />
Is music to thee, screech-owl: prithee, peace.&mdash;<br />
Whate'er thou art that hast enjoyed my sister,<br />
For I am sure thou hear'st me, for thine own sake<br />
Let me not know thee. I came hither prepared<br />
To work thy discovery; yet am now persuaded<br />
It would beget such violent effects<br />
As would damn us both. I would not for ten millions<br />
I had beheld thee: therefore use all means<br />
I never may have knowledge of thy name;<br />
Enjoy thy lust still, and a wretched life,<br />
On that condition.&mdash;And for thee, vile woman,<br />
If thou do wish thy lecher may grow old<br />
In thy embracements, I would have thee build<br />
Such a room for him as our anchorites<br />
To holier use inhabit. Let not the sun<br />
Shine on him till he's dead; let dogs and monkeys<br />
Only converse with him, and such dumb things<br />
To whom nature denies use to sound his name;<br />
Do not keep a paraquito, lest she learn it;<br />
If thou do love him, cut out thine own tongue,<br />
Lest it bewray him.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Why might not I marry?<br />
I have not gone about in this to create<br />
Any new world or custom.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Thou art undone;<br />
And thou hast ta'en that massy sheet of lead<br />
That hid thy husband's bones, and folded it<br />
About my heart.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span><br />
<i>Duch.</i> Mine bleeds for't.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Thine! thy heart!<br />
What should I name't unless a hollow bullet<br />
Filled with unquenchable wild-fire?<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> You are in this<br />
Too strict; and were you not my princely brother,<br />
I would say, too wilful: my reputation<br />
Is safe.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Dost thou know what reputation is?<br />
I'll tell thee,&mdash;to small purpose, since the instruction<br />
Comes now too late.<br />
Upon a time Reputation, Love, and Death,<br />
Would travel o'er the world; and it was concluded<br />
That they should part, and take three several ways.<br />
Death told them, they should find him in great battles,<br />
Or cities plagued with plagues: Love gives them counsel<br />
To inquire for him 'mongst unambitious shepherds,<br />
Where dowries were not talked of, and sometimes<br />
'Mongst quiet kindred that had nothing left<br />
By their dead parents: "Stay," quoth Reputation,<br />
"Do not forsake me; for it is my nature.<br />
If once I part from any man I meet,<br />
I am never found again." And so for you:<br />
You have shook hands with Reputation,<br />
And made him invisible. So, fare you well:<br />
I will never see you more.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Why should only I,<br />
Of all the other princes of the world,<br />
Be cased up, like a holy relic? I have youth<br />
And a little beauty.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> So you have some virgins<br />
That are witches. I will never see thee more. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<i>Duch.</i> Leave us. [<i>Exeunt</i> Officers.<br />
What do you think of these?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> That these are rogues that in's prosperity,<br />
But to have waited on his fortune, could have wished<br />
His dirty stirrup rivetted through their noses,<br />
And followed after's mule, like a bear in a ring;<br />
Would have prostituted their daughters to his lust;<br />
Made their first-born intelligencers; thought none happy<br />
But such as were born under his blest planet,<br />
And wore his livery: and do these lice drop off now?<br />
Well, never look to have the like again:<br />
He hath left a sort of flattering rogues behind him;<br />
Their doom must follow. Princes pay flatterers<br />
In their own money: flatterers dissemble their vices,<br />
And they dissemble their lies; that's justice.<br />
Alas, poor gentleman!<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Poor! he hath amply filled his coffers.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Sure, he was too honest. Pluto,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> the god of riches,<br />
When he's sent by Jupiter to any man,<br />
He goes limping, to signify that wealth<br />
That comes on God's name comes slowly; but when he's sent<br />
On the devil's errand, he rides post and comes in by scuttles.<br />
Let me show you what a most unvalued jewel<br />
You have in a wanton humour thrown away,<br />
To bless the man shall find him. He was an excellent<br />
Courtier and most faithful; a soldier that thought it<br />
As beastly to know his own value too little<br />
As devilish to acknowledge it too much.<br />
Both his virtue and form deserved a far better fortune:<br />
His discourse rather delighted to judge itself than show itself:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>His breast was filled with all perfection,<br />
And yet it seemed a private whispering-room,<br />
It made so little noise of't.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> But he was basely descended.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Will you make yourself a mercenary herald,<br />
Rather to examine men's pedigrees than virtues?<br />
You shall want him:<br />
For know an honest statesman to a prince<br />
Is like a cedar planted by a spring;<br />
The spring bathes the tree's root, the grateful tree<br />
Rewards it with his shadow: you have not done so.<br />
I would sooner swim to the Bermoothes<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> on<br />
Two politicians' rotten bladders, tied<br />
Together with an intelligencer's heart-string,<br />
Than depend on so changeable a prince's favour.<br />
Fare thee well, Antonio! since the malice of the world<br />
Would needs down with thee, it cannot be said yet<br />
That any ill happened unto thee, considering thy fall<br />
Was accompanied with virtue.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> O, you render me excellent music!<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Say you?<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> This good one that you speak of is my husband.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Do I not dream! can this ambitious age<br />
Have so much goodness in't as to prefer<br />
A man merely for worth, without these shadows<br />
Of wealth and painted honours? possible?<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> I have had three children by him.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Fortunate lady!<br />
For you have made your private nuptial bed<br />
The humble and fair seminary of peace.<br />
No question but many an unbeneficed scholar<br />
Shall pray for you for this deed, and rejoice<br />
That some preferment in the world can yet<br />
Arise from merit. The virgins of your land<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>That have no dowries shall hope your example<br />
Will raise them to rich husbands. Should you want<br />
Soldiers, 'twould make the very Turks and Moors<br />
Turn Christians, and serve you for this act.<br />
Last, the neglected poets of your time,<br />
In honour of this trophy of a man,<br />
Raised by that curious engine, your white hand,<br />
Shall thank you, in your grave, for't; and make that<br />
More reverend than all the cabinets<br />
Of living princes. For Antonio.<br />
His fame shall likewise flow from many a pen,<br />
When heralds shall want coats to sell to men.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> As I taste comfort in this friendly speech,<br />
So would I find concealment.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> O, the secret of my prince,<br />
Which I will wear on the inside of my heart!<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> You shall take charge of all my coin and jewels,<br />
And follow him; for he retires himself<br />
To Ancona.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> So.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Whither, within few days,<br />
I mean to follow thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Let me think:<br />
I would wish your grace to feign a pilgrimage<br />
To our Lady of Loretto, scarce seven leagues<br />
From fair Ancona; so may you depart<br />
Your country with more honour, and your flight<br />
Will seem a princely progress, retaining<br />
Your usual train about you.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Sir, your direction<br />
Shall lead me by the hand.<br />
<br />
<i>Cari.</i> In my opinion,<br />
She were better progress to the baths at Lucca,<br />
Or go visit the Spa<br />
In Germany; for, if you will believe me,<br />
I do not like this jesting with religion,<br />
This feignèd pilgrimage.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span><br />
<i>Duch.</i> Thou art a superstitious fool:<br />
Prepare us instantly for our departure.<br />
Past sorrows, let us moderately lament them;<br />
For those to come, seek wisely to prevent them.<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Cariola</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> A politician is the devil's quilted anvil;<br />
He fashions all sins on him, and the blows<br />
Are never heard: he may work in a lady's chamber,<br />
As here for proof. What rests but I reveal<br />
All to my lord? O, this base quality<br />
Of intelligencer! why, every quality i' the world<br />
Prefers but gain or commendation:<br />
Now for this act I am certain to be raised,<br />
And men that paint weeds to the life are praised.<br />

A voluntary lord.<br />

To eat fresh beef and garlic, means to stay<br />
Till the scent be gone, and straight return to court.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> He hath read all the late service<br />
As the city chronicle relates it;<br />
And keeps two pewterers going, only to express<br />
Battles in model.<br />
<br />
<i>Sil.</i> Then he'll fight by the book.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> By the almanac, I think,<br />
To choose good days and shun the critical;<br />
That's his mistress' scarf.<br />
<br />
<i>Sil.</i> Yes, he protests<br />
He would do much for that taffeta.<br />
<br />

To save it from taking prisoner.<br />
<br />
<i>Sil.</i> He is horribly afraid<br />
Gunpowder will spoil the perfume on't.<br />
<br />

Some falling-out amongst the cardinals.<br />
These factions amongst great men, they are like<br />
Foxes, when their heads are divided,<br />
They carry fire in their tails, and all the country<br />
About them goes to wreck for't.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sil.</i> What's that Bosola?</p>

<p><i>Delio.</i> I knew him in Padua&mdash;a fantastical
scholar, like such who study to know how many
knots was in Hercules' club, of what colour Achilles'
beard was, or whether Hector were not troubled
with the toothache. He hath studied himself half
blear-eyed to know the true symmetry of Cæsar's
nose by a shoeing-horn; and this he did to gain
the name of a speculative man.</p>

<p>

A very salamander lives in's eye,<br />
To mock the eager violence of fire.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Sil.</i> That cardinal hath made more bad faces
with his oppression than ever Michael Angelo made
good ones: he lifts up's nose, like a foul porpoise
before a storm.</p>

<p><i>Pes.</i> The Lord Ferdinand laughs.</p>

That lightens ere it smokes.<br />

The pangs of life, that struggle with great statesmen.<br />

To keep her from the sun and tempest?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> That,<br />
That damns her. Methinks her fault and beauty,<br />
Blended together, show like leprosy,<br />
The whiter, the fouler. I make it a question<br />
Whether her beggarly brats were ever christened.<br />
<br />

To have them banished.<br />

Unto so mean a person? yet the cardinal<br />
Bears himself much too cruel.<br />
<br />

Of Ancona to determine of a free prince?<br />
<br />

How that the Pope, fore-hearing of her looseness,<br />
Hath seized into the protection of the church<br />
The dukedom which she held as dowager.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Pil.</i> But by what justice?<br />
<br />
<i>2nd Pil.</i> Sure, I think by none,<br />
Only her brother's instigation.<br />
<br />

Off from her finger?<br />
<br />

Shrunk to this poor remainder?<br />

Which have got little in your service, vow<br />
To take your fortune: but your wiser buntings,<br />
Now they are fledged, are gone.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> They have done wisely.<br />
This puts me in mind of death: physicians thus,<br />
With their hands full of money, use to give o'er<br />
Their patients.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Right the fashion of the world:<br />
From decayed fortunes every flatterer shrinks;<br />
Men cease to build where the foundation sinks.<br />

Were changed to pearls.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span><br />

Do signify your tears.<br />

<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Yes, from the Lord Ferdinand your brother<br />
All love and safety.<br />

At sea before a tempest, false hearts speak fair<br />
To those they intend most mischief. [<i>Reads.</i><br />
"Send Antonio to me; I want his head in a
business."<br />
A politic equivocation!<br />
He doth not want your counsel, but your head;<br />
That is, he cannot sleep till you be dead.<br />
And here's another pitfall that's strewed o'er<br />
With roses; mark it, 'tis a cunning one: [<i>Reads.</i><br />
"I stand engaged for your husband, for several
debts at Naples: let not that trouble him; I had
rather have his heart than his money:"&mdash;<br />
And I believe so too.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> What do you believe?<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> That he so much distrusts my husband's love,<br />
He will by no means believe his heart is with him<br />
Until he sees it: the devil is not cunning enough<br />
To circumvent us in riddles.<br />
<br />

Of amity and love which I present you?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span><br />

Only to make themselves of strength and power<br />
To be our after-ruin: tell them so.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> And what from you?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Thus tell him; I will not come.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> And what of this?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> My brothers have dispersed<br />
Blood-hounds abroad; which till I hear are muzzled,<br />
No truce, though hatched with ne'er such politic skill,<br />
Is safe, that hangs upon our enemies' will.<br />
I'll not come at them.<br />

As the adamant draws iron. Fare you well, sir:<br />
You shall shortly hear from's. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

Therefore by all my love I do conjure you<br />
To take your eldest son, and fly towards Milan.<br />

In one unlucky bottom.<br />

Best of my life, farewell, since we must part:<br />
Heaven hath a hand in't; but no otherwise<br />
Than as some curious artist takes in sunder<br />
A clock or watch, when it is out of frame,<br />

To see you dead, or part with you.&mdash;Farewell, boy:<br />
Thou art happy that thou hast not understanding<br />
To know thy misery; for all our wit<br />
And reading brings us to a truer sense<br />
Of sorrow.&mdash;In the eternal church, sir,<br />
I do hope we shall not part thus.<br />
<br />

Make patience a noble fortitude,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>And think not how unkindly we are used:<br />
Man, like to cassia, is proved best being bruised.<br />

Account it praise to suffer tyranny?<br />
And yet, O Heaven, thy heavy hand is in't!<br />
I have seen my little boy oft scourge his top,<br />
And compared myself to't: naught made me e'er<br />
Go right but Heaven's scourge-stick.<br />

Heaven fashioned us of nothing, and we strive<br />
To bring ourselves to nothing.&mdash;Farewell, Cariola,<br />
And thy sweet armful.&mdash;If I do never see thee more,<br />
Be a good mother to your little ones,<br />
And save them from the tiger: fare you well.<br />

Came from a dying father: your kiss is colder<br />
Than that I have seen an holy anchorite<br />
Give to a dead man's skull.<br />

<i>Ferd.</i> How doth our sister duchess bear herself<br />
In her imprisonment?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Nobly: I'll describe her.<br />
She's sad as one long used to't, and she seems<br />
Rather to welcome the end of misery<br />
Than shun it; a behaviour so noble<br />
As gives a majesty to adversity:<br />
You may discern the shape of loveliness<br />
More perfect in her tears than in her smiles:<br />
She will muse four hours together; and her silence,<br />
Methinks, expresseth more than if she spake.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Her melancholy seems to be fortified<br />
With a strange disdain.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> 'Tis so; and this restraint,<br />
Like English mastiffs that grow fierce with tying,<br />
Makes her too passionately apprehend<br />
Those pleasures she's kept from.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Curse upon her!<br />
I will no longer study in the book<br />
Of another's heart. Inform her what I told you.<br />

Pray thee, why dost thou wrap thy poisoned pills<br />
In gold and sugar?<br />
<br />

'Cause once he rashly made a solemn vow<br />
Never to see you more, he comes i' the night;<br />

<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Here, sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> This darkness suits you well.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> I would ask you pardon.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> You have it;<br />
For I account it the honorabl'st revenge,<br />
Where I may kill, to pardon.&mdash;Where are your cubs?<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Whom?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Call them your children;<br />
For though our national law distinguish bastards<br />
From true legitimate issue, compassionate nature<br />
Makes them all equal.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Do you visit me for this?<br />
You violate a sacrament o' the church<br />
Shall make you howl in hell for't.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> It had been well,<br />
Could you have lived thus always; for, indeed,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>You were too much i' the light:&mdash;but no more;<br />
I come to seal my peace with you. Here's a hand<br />
[<i>Gives her a dead man's hand.</i><br />
To which you have vowed much love; the ring upon't<br />
You gave.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Pray, do, and bury the print of it in your heart.<br />
I will leave this ring with you for a love-token;<br />
And the hand as sure as the ring; and do not doubt<br />
But you shall have the heart too: when you need a friend,<br />
Send it to him that owned it; you shall see<br />
Whether he can aid you.<br />
<br />

I fear you are not well after your travel.&mdash;<br />
Ha! lights! O, horrible!<br />
<br />

A dead man's hand here?<br />
[<i>Here is discovered, behind a traverse,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> the artificial

as if they were dead.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Look you, here's the piece from which 'twas ta'en.<br />
He doth present you this sad spectacle,<br />
That, now you know directly they are dead,<br />
Hereafter you may wisely cease to grieve<br />
For that which cannot be recoverèd.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> There is not between Heaven and earth one wish<br />
I stay for after this: it wastes me more<br />
Than were't my picture, fashioned out of wax,<br />
Stuck with a magical needle, and then buried<br />
In some foul dunghill; and yond's an excellent property<br />
For a tyrant, which I would account mercy.<br />
<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span><br />
<i>Duch.</i> If they would bind me to that lifeless trunk,<br />
And let me freeze to death.<br />
<br />

<br />

In hell, that they must live, and cannot die.<br />
Portia, I'll new kindle thy coals again,<br />
And revive the rare and almost dead example<br />
Of a loving wife.<br />

You are a Christian.<br />
<br />

I'll starve myself to death.<br />

Things being at the worst begin to mend: the bee<br />
When he hath shot his sting into your hand,<br />
May then play with your eyelid.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Good comfortable fellow,<br />
Persuade a wretch that's broke upon the wheel<br />
To have all his bones new set; entreat him live<br />
To be executed again. Who must despatch me?<br />
I account this world a tedious theatre,<br />
For I do play a part in't 'gainst my will.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Come, be of comfort; I will save your life.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Indeed, I have not leisure to tend<br />
So small a business.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Now, by my life, I pity you.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Thou art a fool, then,<br />
To waste thy pity on a thing so wretched<br />
As cannot pity itself. I am full of daggers.<br />
Puff, let me blow these vipers from me.<br />

No, I'll go curse.<br />

Into a Russian winter: nay, the world<br />
To its first chaos.<br />

Never be remembered but for the ill they have done;<br />
Let all the zealous prayers of mortified<br />
Churchmen forget them!&mdash;<br />

<i>Ferd.</i> Excellent, as I would wish; she's plagued in art:<br />
These presentations are but framed in wax<br />
By the curious master in that quality,<br />
Vincentio Lauriola, and she takes them<br />
For true substantial bodies.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />

And go no farther in your cruelty:<br />
Send her a penitential garment to put on<br />
Next to her delicate skin, and furnish her<br />

<i>Ferd.</i> Damn her! that body of hers,<br />
While that my blood ran pure in't, was more worth<br />
Than that which thou wouldst comfort, called a soul.<br />
I will send her masks of common courtezans,<br />
Have her meat served up by bawds and ruffians,<br />
And, 'cause she'll needs be mad, I am resolved<br />
To remove forth the common hospital<br />
All the mad-folk, and place them near her lodging;<br />
There let them practise together, sing and dance,<br />

Thy pity is nothing of kin to thee. Antonio<br />

Of madmen, lady, which your tyrant brother<br />

I think, was never practised till this hour.<br />
<br />

Can keep me in my right wits; whereas reason<br />
And silence make me stark mad. Sit down;<br />
Discourse to me some dismal tragedy.<br />

A doctor that hath forfeited his wits<br />
By jealousy; an astrologian<br />
That in his works said such a day o' the month<br />
Should be the day of doom, and, failing of't,<br />
Ran mad; an English tailor crazed i' the brain<br />
With the study of new fashions; a gentleman-usher<br />
Quite beside himself with care to keep in mind<br />
The number of his lady's salutations<br />
Or "How do you" she employed him in each morning;<br />
A farmer, too, an excellent knave in grain,<br />
Mad 'cause he was hindered transportation:<br />
And let one broker that's mad loose to these,<br />
You'd think the devil were among them.<br />

<p><i>Bos.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Duch.</i> Who am I?</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Thou art a box of worm-seed, at best but a
salvatory of green mummy. What's this flesh? a
little crudded milk, fantastical puff-paste. Our
bodies are weaker than those paper-prisons boys use
to keep flies in; more contemptible, since ours is to
preserve earth-worms. Didst thou ever see a lark in
a cage? Such is the soul in the body: this world is
like her little turf of grass, and the Heaven o'er our
heads, like her looking-glass, only gives us a miserable
knowledge of the small compass of our prison.</p>

<p><i>Duch.</i> Am not I thy duchess?</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Thou art some great woman, sure, for riot
begins to sit on thy forehead (clad in grey hairs)
twenty years sooner than on a merry milkmaid's.
Thou sleepest worse than if a mouse should be
forced to take up her lodging in a cat's ear: a little
infant that breeds its teeth, should it lie with thee,
would cry out, as if thou wert the more unquiet
bedfellow.</p>

<p><i>Duch.</i> I am Duchess of Malfi still.</p>

<p>
<i>Bos.</i> That makes thy sleeps so broken:<br />
Glories, like glow-worms, afar off shine bright,<br />
But looked to near, have neither heat nor light.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Duch.</i> Thou art very plain.</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> My trade is to flatter the dead, not the living;
I am a tomb-maker.</p>

<p><i>Duch.</i> And thou comest to make my tomb?</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Duch.</i> Let me be a little merry:&mdash;of what stuff
wilt thou make it?</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Nay, resolve me first, of what fashion?</p>

<p><i>Duch.</i> Why do we grow fantastical in our death-bed?
do we affect fashion in the grave?</p>

<p><i>Bos.</i> Most ambitiously. Princes' images on their
tombs do not lie, as they were wont, seeming to pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
up to Heaven; but with their hands under their
cheeks, as if they died of the toothache: they are not
carved with their eyes fixed upon the stars; but as
their minds were wholly bent upon the world, the
self-same way they seem to turn their faces.</p>

<i>Ferd.</i> Is she dead?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> She is what<br />
You'd have her. But here begin your pity:<br />
[<i>Shows the</i> Children <i>strangled.</i><br />
Alas, how have these offended?<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> The death<br />
Of young wolves is never to be pitied.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Fix your eye here.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Constantly.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Do you not weep?<br />
Other sins only speak; murder shrieks out:<br />
The element of water moistens the earth,<br />
But blood flies upwards and bedews the heavens.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle: she died young.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> I think not so; her infelicity<br />
Seemed to have years too many.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> She and I were twins;<br />
And should I die this instant, I had lived<br />
Her time to a minute.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> It seems she was born first:<br />
You have bloodily approved the ancient truth,<br />
That kindred commonly do worse agree<br />
Than remote strangers.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Let me see her face<br />
Again. Why didst not thou pity her? what<br />
An excellent honest man mightst thou have been,<br />
If thou hadst born her to some sanctuary!<br />
Or, bold in a good cause, opposed thyself,<br />
With thy advancèd sword above thy head,<br />
Between her innocence and my revenge!<br />
I bade thee, when I was distracted of my wits,<br />
Go kill my dearest friend, and thou hast done't.<br />
For let me but examine well the cause:<br />
What was the meanness of her match to me?<br />
Only I must confess I had a hope,<br />
Had she continued widow, to have gained<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>An infinite mass of treasure by her death:<br />
And what was the main cause? her marriage,<br />
That drew a stream of gall quite through my heart.<br />
For thee, as we observe in tragedies<br />
That a good actor many times is cursed<br />
For playing a villain's part, I hate thee for't,<br />
And, for my sake, say, thou hast done much ill well.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Let me quicken your memory, for I perceive<br />
You are falling into ingratitude: I challenge<br />
The reward due to my service.<br />
<br />

What I'll give thee.<br />
<br />

<br />

For this murder.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Ha!<br />
<br />

The largest bounty I can study to do thee.<br />
By what authority didst thou execute<br />
This bloody sentence?<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> By yours.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Mine! was I her judge?<br />
Did any ceremonial form of law<br />
Doom her to not-being? did a còmplete jury<br />
Deliver her conviction up i' the court?<br />
Where shalt thou find this judgment registered,<br />
Unless in hell? See, like a bloody fool,<br />
Thou'st forfeited thy life, and thou shalt die for't.<br />
<br />

When one thief hangs another. Who shall dare<br />
To reveal this?<br />
<br />

Is judge, I am so.<br />
<br />

That not the fear of him which binds the devils<br />
Can prescribe man obedience!&mdash;<br />
Never look upon me more.<br />
<br />

Your brother and yourself are worthy men:<br />
You have a pair of hearts are hollow graves,<br />
Rotten, and rotting others; and your vengeance,<br />
Like two chained bullets, still goes arm in arm:<br />
You may be brothers; for treason, like the plague,<br />
Doth take much in a blood. I stand like one<br />
That long hath ta'en a sweet and golden dream:<br />
I am angry with myself, now that I wake.<br />
<br />
<i>Ferd.</i> Get thee into some unknown part o' the world,<br />
That I may never see thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Let me know<br />
Wherefore I should be thus neglected. Sir,<br />
I served your tyranny, and rather strove<br />
To satisfy yourself than all the world:<br />
And though I loathed the evil, yet I loved<br />
You that did counsel it; and rather sought<br />
To appear a true servant than an honest man.<br />
<br />

'Tis a deed of darkness. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />

While with vain hopes our faculties we tire,<br />
We seem to sweat in ice and freeze in fire.<br />

I would not change my peace of conscience<br />

Some cordial drink!&mdash;Alas! I dare not call:<br />

O sacred innocence, that sweetly sleeps<br />
On turtles' feathers, whilst a guilty conscience<br />
Is a black register wherein is writ<br />
All our good deeds and bad, a perspective<br />
That shows us hell! That we cannot be suffered<br />
To do good when we have a mind to it!<br />
This is manly sorrow;<br />
These tears, I am very certain, never grew<br />
In my mother's milk: my estate is sunk<br />
Below the degree of fear: where were<br />
These penitent fountains while she was living?<br />
O, they were frozen up! Here is a sight<br />
As direful to my soul as is the sword<br />
Unto a wretch hath slain his father. Come,<br />
I'll bear thee hence,<br />
And execute thy last will; that's deliver<br />
Thy body to the reverend dispose<br />
Of some good women: that the cruel tyrant<br />
Shall not deny me. Then I'll post to Milan,<br />
Where somewhat I will speedily enact<br />
Worth my dejection. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Public Place in Milan.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Delio</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Ant.</i> What think you of my hope of reconcilement<br />
To the Arragonian brethren?<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> I misdoubt it;<br />
For though they have sent their letters of safe-conduct<br />
For your repair to Milan, they appear<br />
But nets to entrap you. The Marquis of Pescara,<br />
Under whom you hold certain land in cheat,<br />
Much 'gainst his noble nature hath been moved<br />
To seize those lands; and some of his dependants<br />
Are at this instant making it their suit<br />
To be invested in your revenues.<br />
I cannot think they mean well to your life<br />
That do deprive you of your means of life,<br />
Your living.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> You are still an heretic<br />
To any safety I can shape myself.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Here comes the marquis: I will make myself<br />
Petitioner for some part of your land,<br />
To know whither it is flying.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I pray do.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pescara</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Delio.</i> Sir, I have a suit to you.<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> To me?<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> An easy one:<br />
There is the citadel of Saint Bennet,<br />
With some demesnes, of late in the possession<br />
Of Antonio Bologna,&mdash;please you bestow them on me.<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> You are my friend; but this is such a suit,<br />
Nor fit for me to give, nor you to take.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> No, sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> I will give you ample reason for't<br />
Soon in private:&mdash;here's the cardinal's mistress.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Julia</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Julia.</i> My lord, I am grown your poor petitioner,<br />
And should be an ill beggar, had I not<br />
A great man's letter here, the cardinal's,<br />
To court you in my favour. [<i>Gives a letter.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> He entreats for you<br />
The citadel of Saint Bennet, that belonged<br />
To the banished Bologna.<br />
<br />
<i>Julia.</i> Yes.<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> I could not have thought of a friend I could rather<br />
Pleasure with it: 'tis yours.<br />
<br />
<i>Julia.</i> Sir, I thank you;<br />
And he shall know how doubly I am engaged<br />
Both in your gift, and speediness of giving<br />
Which makes your grant the greater. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> How they fortify<br />
Themselves with my ruin!<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Sir, I am<br />
Little bound to you.<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> Why?<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Because you denied this suit to me, and gave't<br />
To such a creature.<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> Do you know what it was?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>It was Antonio's land; not forfeited<br />
By course of law, but ravished from his throat<br />
By the cardinal's entreaty: it were not fit<br />
I should bestow so main a piece of wrong<br />
Upon my friend; 'tis a gratification<br />
Only due to a strumpet, for it is injustice.<br />
Shall I sprinkle the pure blood of innocents<br />
To make those followers I call my friends<br />
Look ruddier upon me? I am glad<br />
This land, ta'en from the owner by such wrong,<br />
Returns again unto so foul an use<br />
As salary for his lust. Learn, good Delio,<br />
To ask noble things of me, and you shall find<br />
I'll be a noble giver.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> You instruct me well.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Why, here's a man now would fright impudence<br />
From sauciest beggars.<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> Prince Ferdinand's come to Milan,<br />
Sick, as they give out, of an apoplexy;<br />
But some say 'tis a frenzy: I am going<br />
To visit him. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> 'Tis a noble old fellow.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> What course do you mean to take, Antonio?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> This night I mean to venture all my fortune,<br />
Which is no more than a poor lingering life,<br />
To the cardinal's worst of malice: I have got<br />
Private access to his chamber; and intend<br />
To visit him about the mid of night,<br />
As once his brother did our noble duchess.<br />
It may be that the sudden apprehension<br />
Of danger,&mdash;for I'll go in mine own shape,&mdash;<br />
When he shall see it fraight<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> with love and duty,<br />
May draw the poison out of him, and work<br />
A friendly reconcilement: if it fail,<br />
Yet it shall rid me of this infamous calling;<br />
For better fall once than be ever falling.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span><br />
<i>Delio.</i> I'll second you in all danger; and, howe'er,<br />
My life keeps rank with yours.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> You are still my loved and best friend.<br />
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

<p>
<i>Pes.</i> Now, doctor, may I visit your patient?<br />
<br />
<i>Doc.</i> If't please your lordship: but he's instantly<br />
To take the air here in the gallery<br />
By my direction.<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> Pray thee, what's his disease?<br />
<br />
<i>Doc.</i> A very pestilent disease, my lord,<br />
They call lycanthropia.<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> What's that?<br />
I need a dictionary to't.<br />
<br />
<i>Doc.</i> I'll tell you.<br />
In those that are possessed with't there o'erflows<br />
Such melancholy humour they imagine<br />
Themselves to be transformed into wolves;<br />
Steal forth to churchyards in the dead of night,<br />
And dig dead bodies up: as two nights since<br />
One met the duke 'bout midnight in a lane<br />
Behind Saint Mark's church, with the leg of a man<br />
Upon his shoulder; and he howled fearfully;<br />
Said he was a wolf, only the difference<br />
Was, a wolf's skin was hairy on the outside,<br />
His on the inside; bade them take their swords,<br />
Rip up his flesh, and try: straight I was sent for,<br />
And, having ministered to him, found his grace<br />
Very well recovered.<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> I am glad on't.<br />
<br />
<i>Doc.</i> Yet not without some fear<br />
Of a relapse. If he grow to his fit again,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>I'll go a nearer way to work with him<br />
Than ever Paracelsus dreamed of; if<br />
They'll give me leave, I'll buffet his madness out of him.<br />
Stand aside; he comes.<br />

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Leave me.</p>

<p><i>Mal.</i> Why doth your lordship love this solitariness?</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Eagles commonly fly alone: they are crows,
daws, and starlings that flock together. Look,
what's that follows me?</p>

<p><i>Mal.</i> Nothing, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Mal.</i> 'Tis your shadow.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Stay it; let it not haunt me.</p>

<p><i>Mal.</i> Impossible, if you move, and the sun shine.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> I will throttle it.
[<i>Throws himself down on his shadow.</i></p>

<p><i>Mal.</i> O, my lord, you are angry with nothing.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> You are a fool: how is't possible I should
catch my shadow, unless I fall upon't? When I go
to hell, I mean to carry a bribe; for, look you, good
gifts evermore make way for the worst persons.</p>

<p><i>Pes.</i> Rise, good my lord.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> I am studying the art of patience.</p>

<p><i>Pes.</i> 'Tis a noble virtue.</p>

town to Moscow; neither use goad nor whip to
them, but let them take their own time;&mdash;the

I'll crawl after like a sheep-biter.</p>

<p><i>Card.</i> Force him up. [<i>They raise him.</i></p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Use me well, you were best. What I have
done, I have done: I'll confess nothing.</p>

<p><i>Doc.</i> Now let me come to him.&mdash;Are you mad, my
lord? are you out of your princely wits?</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> What's he?</p>

<p><i>Pes.</i> Your doctor.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Let me have his beard sawed off, and his
eyebrows filed more civil.</p>

<p><i>Doc.</i> I must do mad tricks with him, for that's
the only way on't.&mdash;I have brought your grace a
salamander's skin to keep you from sun-burning.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> I have cruel sore eyes.</p>

<p><i>Doc.</i> The white of a cockatrix's egg is present
remedy.</p>

<p>
<i>Ferd.</i> Let it be a new laid one, you were best.&mdash;<br />
Hide me from him: physicians are like kings,&mdash;<br />
They brook no contradiction.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Doc.</i> Now he begins to fear me: now let me alone
with him.</p>

<p><i>Card.</i> How-now! put off your gown!</p>

<p><i>Doc.</i> Let me have some forty urinals filled with
rose-water: he and I'll go pelt one another with
them.&mdash;Now he begins to fear me.&mdash;Can you fetch
a frisk, sir?&mdash;Let him go, let him go, upon my peril:
I find by his eye he stands in awe of me; I'll make
him as tame as a dormouse.</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> Can you fetch your frisks, sir!&mdash;I will

One night, as the prince sat up late at's book,<br />
Appeared to him; when crying out for help,<br />
The gentlemen of's chamber found his grace<br />
All on a cold sweat, altered much in face<br />
And language: since which apparition,<br />
He hath grown worse and worse, and I much fear<br />
He cannot live.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Sir, I would speak with you.<br />
<br />
<i>Pes.</i> We'll leave your grace,<br />
Wishing to the sick prince, our noble lord,<br />
All health of mind and body.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> You are most welcome.<br />

Are you come? so.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] This fellow must not know<br />
By any means I had intelligence<br />
In our duchess' death; for, though I counselled it,<br />
The full of all the engagement seemed to grow<br />
From Ferdinand.&mdash;Now, sir, how fares our sister?<br />
I do not think but sorrow makes her look<br />
Like to an oft-dyed garment: she shall now<br />
Taste comfort from me. Why do you look so wildly?<br />
O, the fortune of your master here the prince<br />
Dejects you; but be you of happy comfort:<br />
If you'll do one thing for me I'll entreat,<br />
Though he had a cold tombstone o'er his bones,<br />
I'd make you what you would be.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Any thing;<br />
Give it me in a breath, and let me fly to't:<br />
They that think long small expedition win,<br />
For musing much o' the end cannot begin.<br />

<p>
<i>Julia.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] What an excellent shape hath that fellow!<br />
[<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> 'Tis thus. Antonio lurks here in Milan:<br />
Inquire him out, and kill him. While he lives,<br />
Our sister cannot marry; and I have thought<br />
Of an excellent match for her. Do this, and style me<br />
Thy advancement.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> But by what means shall I find him out?<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> There is a gentleman called Delio<br />
Here in the camp, that hath been long approved<br />
His loyal friend. Set eye upon that fellow;<br />
Follow him to mass; may be Antonio,<br />
Although he do account religion<br />
But a school-name, for fashion of the world<br />
May accompany him; or else go inquire out<br />
Delio's confessor, and see if you can bribe<br />
Him to reveal it. There are a thousand ways<br />
A man might find to trace him; as to know<br />
What fellows haunt the Jews for taking up<br />
Great sums of money, for sure he's in want;<br />
Or else to go to the picture-makers, and learn<br />
Who bought her picture lately: some of these<br />
Happily may take.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> Well, I'll not freeze i' the business:<br />
I would see that wretched thing, Antonio,<br />
Above all sights i' the world.<br />
<br />
<i>Card.</i> Do, and be happy. [<i>Exit</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Bos.</i> This fellow doth breed basilisks in's eyes,<br />
He's nothing else but murder; yet he seems<br />
Not to have notice of the duchess' death.<br />
'Tis his cunning: I must follow his example;<br />
There cannot be a surer way to trace<br />
Than that of an old fox.<br />

Let us grow most amorously familiar:<br />
If the great cardinal now should see me thus,<br />
Would he not count me a villain?<br />

Not lay a scruple of offence on you;<br />
For if I see and steal a diamond,<br />
The fault is not i' the stone, but in me the thief<br />
That purloins it. I am sudden with you:<br />
We that are great women of pleasure use to cut off<br />
These uncertain wishes and unquiet longings,<br />
And in an instant join the sweet delight<br />
And the pretty excuse together. Had you been i' the street,<br />
Under my chamber-window, even there<br />
I should have courted you.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Julia.</i> Bid me do somewhat for you presently<br />
To express I love you.<br />
<br />

Fail not to effect it.<br />

Demand the cause, let him not put you off<br />
With feigned excuse; discover the main ground on't.<br />
<br />

<br />

And I hear that he is fall'n in some disgrace<br />
With the emperor: if he be, like the mice<br />

To receive a prince's secrets: they that do,<br />

Grew from the ruins of an ancient abbey;<br />
And to yond side o' the river lies a wall,<br />
Piece of a cloister, which in my opinion<br />
Gives the best echo that you ever heard,<br />
So hollow and so dismal, and withal<br />
So plain in the distinction of our words,<br />
That many have supposed it is a spirit<br />
That answers.<br />

Of stormy weather, some men lie interred<br />
Loved the church so well, and gave so largely to't,<br />
They thought it should have canopied their bones<br />

Churches and cities, which have diseases like to men,<br />
Must have like death that we have.<br />

A very deadly accent.<br />
<br />
<i>Echo.</i> "Deadly accent."<br />

<i>Delio.</i> I told you 'twas a pretty one: you may make it<br />
A huntsman, or a falconer, a musician,<br />
Or a thing of sorrow.<br />

Than time: take time for't; be mindful of thy safety.<br />

Make scrutiny throughout the passages<br />
Of your own life, you'll find it impossible<br />
To fly your fate.<br />

And give you good counsel.<br />

For thou art a dead thing.<br />

And her little ones, I hope sweetly: O Heaven,<br />
Shall I never see her more?<br />

<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I marked not one repetition of the echo<br />
But that; and on the sudden a clear light<br />
Presented me a face folded in sorrow.<br />
<br />
<i>Delio.</i> Your fancy merely.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Come, I'll be out of this ague,<br />
For to live thus is not indeed to live;<br />
It is a mockery and abuse of life:<br />
I will not henceforth save myself by halves;<br />
Lose all, or nothing.<br />

I'll fetch your eldest son, and second you:<br />
It may be that the sight of his own blood<br />
Spread in so sweet a figure may beget<br />
The more compassion. However, fare you well.<br />

The man I would have saved 'bove mine own life!<br />

Wish my wounds balmed nor healed, for I have no use<br />
To put my life to. In all our quest of greatness,<br />
Like wanton boys, whose pastime is their care,<br />
We follow after bubbles blown in the air.<br />
Pleasure of life, what is't? only the good hours<br />
Of an ague; merely a preparative to rest,<br />
To endure vexation. I do not ask<br />
The process of my death; only commend me<br />
To Delio.<br />

To have reconciled him to the cardinal.<br />

Take him up, if thou tender thine own life,<br />
And bear him where the lady Julia<br />
Was wont to lodge.&mdash;O, my fate moves swift;<br />
I have this cardinal in the forge already;<br />
Now I'll bring him to the hammer. O direful misprision!<br />

Of this great ruin; and join all our force<br />
To establish this young hopeful gentleman<br />

Leave no more fame behind 'em, than should one<br />
Fall in a frost, and leave his print in snow;<br />
As soon as the sun shines, it ever melts,<br />
Both form and matter. I have ever thought<br />
Nature doth nothing so great for great men<br />
As when she's pleased to make them lords of truth:<br />
Integrity of life is fame's best friend,<br />
Which nobly, beyond death, shall crown the end.<br />

<h2>THE
ATHEIST'S TRAGEDY.</h2>


<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.<i>&mdash;In the Grounds of</i> <span class="smcap">D'Amville's</span> <i>Mansion.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">D'Amville, Borachio</span>, <i>and</i> Attendants.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>D'Am.</i> I saw my nephew Charlemont but now<br />
Part from his father. Tell him I desire<br />
To speak with him. [<i>Exit</i> Servant.<br />
Borachio, thou art read<br />
In nature and her large philosophy.<br />
Observ'st thou not the very self-same course<br />
Of revolution, both in man and beast?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> The same, for birth, growth, state, decay and death;<br />
Only a man's beholding to his nature<br />
For the better composition o' the two.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> But where that favour of his nature is<br />
Not full and free, you see a man becomes<br />
A fool, as little-knowing as a beast.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> That shows there's nothing in a man above<br />
His nature; if there were, considering 'tis<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>His being's excellency, 'twould not yield<br />
To nature's weakness.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Then, if Death casts up<br />
Our total sum of joy and happiness,<br />
Let me have all my senses feasted in<br />
The abundant fulness of delight at once,<br />
And, with a sweet insensible increase<br />
Of pleasing surfeit, melt into my dust.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> That revolution is too short, methinks.<br />
If this life comprehends our happiness,<br />
How foolish to desire to die so soon!<br />
And if our time runs home unto the length<br />
Of nature, how improvident it were<br />
To spend our substance on a minute's pleasure,<br />
And after, live an age in misery!<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> So thou conclud'st that pleasure only flows<br />
Upon the stream of riches?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Wealth is lord<br />
Of all felicity.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> 'Tis, oracle.<br />
For what's a man that's honest without wealth?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Both miserable and contemptible.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> He's worse, Borachio. For if charity<br />
Be an essential part of honesty,<br />
And should be practised first upon ourselves,<br />
Which must be granted, then your honest man<br />
That's poor, is most dishonest, for he is<br />
Uncharitable to the man whom he<br />
Should most respect. But what doth this touch me<br />
That seem to have enough?&mdash;thanks industry.<br />
'Tis true, had not my body spread itself<br />
Into posterity, perhaps I should<br />
Desire no more increase of substance, than<br />
Would hold proportion with mine own dimensions.<br />
Yet even in that sufficiency of state,<br />
A man has reason to provide and add.<br />
For what is he hath such a present eye,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>And so prepared a strength, that can foresee,<br />
And fortify his substance and himself<br />
Against those accidents, the least whereof<br />
May rob him of an age's husbandry?<br />
And for my children, they are as near to me<br />
As branches to the tree whereon they grow;<br />
And may as numerously be multiplied.<br />
As they increase, so should my providence;<br />
For from my substance they receive the sap,<br />
Whereby they live and flourish.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Sir, enough.<br />
I understand the mark whereat you aim.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charlemont</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>D'Am.</i> Silence, we are interrupted. Charlemont!<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> Good morrow, uncle.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Noble Charlemont,<br />
Good morrow. Is not this the honoured day<br />
You purposed to set forward to the war?<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> My inclination did intend it so.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> And not your resolution?<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> Yes, my lord;<br />
Had not my father contradicted it.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> O noble war! Thou first original<br />
Of all man's honour, how dejectedly<br />
The baser spirit of our present time<br />
Hath cast itself below the ancient worth<br />
Of our forefathers, from whose noble deeds<br />
Ignobly we derive our pedigrees.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> Sir, tax not me for his unwillingness.<br />
By the command of his authority<br />
My disposition's forced against itself.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Nephew, you are the honour of our blood.<br />
The troop of gentry, whose inferior worth<br />
Should second your example, are become<br />
Your leaders; and the scorn of their discourse<br />
Turns smiling back upon your backwardness.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span><br />
<i>Charl.</i> You need not urge my spirit by disgrace,<br />
'Tis free enough; my father hinders it.<br />
To curb me, he denies me maintenance<br />
To put me in the habit of my rank.<br />
Unbind me from that strong necessity,&mdash;<br />
And call me coward, if I stay behind.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> For want of means? Borachio, where's the gold?<br />
I'd disinherit my posterity<br />
To purchase honour. 'Tis an interest<br />
I prize above the principal of wealth.<br />
I'm glad I had the occasion to make known<br />
How readily my substance shall unlock<br />
Itself to serve you. Here's a thousand crowns.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> My worthy uncle, in exchange for this<br />
I leave my bond; so I am doubly bound;<br />
By that, for the repayment of this gold,<br />
And by this gold, to satisfy your love.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Sir, 'tis a witness only of my love,<br />
And love doth always satisfy itself.<br />
Now to your father, labour his consent,<br />
My importunity shall second yours.<br />
We will obtain it.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> If entreaty fail,<br />
The force of reputation shall prevail. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Go call my sons, that they may take their leaves<br />
Of noble Charlemont. Now, my Borachio!<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> The substance of our former argument<br />
Was wealth.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> The question, how to compass it.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Young Charlemont is going to the war.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> O, thou begin'st to take me!<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Mark me then.<br />
Methinks the pregnant wit of man might make<br />
The happy absence of this Charlemont<br />
A subject of commodious providence.<br />
He has a wealthy father, ready even<br />
To drop into his grave. And no man's power,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>When Charlemont is gone, can interpose<br />
'Twixt you and him.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Thou hast apprehended both<br />
My meaning and my love. Now let thy trust,<br />
For undertaking and for secrecy<br />
Hold measure with thy amplitude of wit;<br />
And thy reward shall parallel thy worth.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> My resolution has already bound<br />
Me to your service.<br />
<br />

Here are my sons.&mdash;<br />
There's my eternity. My life in them<br />
And their succession shall for ever live.<br />
And in my reason dwells the providence<br />
To add to life as much of happiness.<br />
Let all men lose, so I increase my gain,<br />
I have no feeling of another's pain. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

<p>
<i>Mont.</i> I prithee, let this current of my tears<br />
Divert thy inclination from the war,<br />
For of my children thou art only left<br />
To promise a succession to my house.<br />
And all the honour thou canst get by arms<br />
Will give but vain addition to thy name;<br />
Since from thy ancestors thou dost derive<br />
A dignity sufficient, and as great<br />
As thou hast substance to maintain and bear.<br />
I prithee, stay at home.<br />

Obedience; but my affection to the war<br />

Your predecessors were your precedents,<br />
And you are my example. Shall I serve<br />
For nothing but a vain parenthesis<br />
I' the honoured story of your family?<br />
Or hang but like an empty scutcheon<br />
Between the trophies of my predecessors,<br />
And the rich arms of my posterity?<br />
There's not a Frenchman of good blood and youth,<br />

Is turned a soldier. Only Charlemont<br />
Must be reputed that same heartless thing<br />

<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Morrow, kind nephew.<br />
What, ha' you washed your eyes wi' tears this morning?<br />
Come, by my soul, his purpose does deserve<br />
Your free consent;&mdash;your tenderness dissuades him.<br />
What to the father of a gentleman<br />
Should be more tender than the maintenance<br />
And the increase of honour to his house?<br />
My lord, here are my boys. I should be proud<br />
That either this were able, or that inclined<br />
To be my nephew's brave competitor.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> Your importunities have overcome.<br />
Pray God my forced grant prove not ominous!<br />
<br />

It cannot be in anything but death.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>And I am of a confident belief<br />
That even the time, place, manner of our deaths<br />
Do follow Fate with that necessity<br />
That makes us sure to die. And in a thing<br />
Ordained so certainly unalterable,<br />
What can the use of providence prevail?<br />

<i>Bel.</i> Morrow, my Lord Montferrers, Lord D'Amville.<br />
Good morrow, gentlemen. Cousin Charlemont,<br />
Kindly good morrow. Troth, I was afeared<br />
I should ha' come too late to tell you that<br />
I wish your undertakings a success<br />
That may deserve the measure of their worth.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> My lord, my duty would not let me go<br />
Without receiving your commandëments.<br />
<br />
<i>Bel.</i> Accompliments are more for ornament<br />
Then use. We should employ no time in them<br />
But what our serious business will admit.<br />
<br />
<i>Mont.</i> Your favour had by his duty been prevented<br />
If we had not withheld him in the way.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> He was a coming to present his service;<br />
But now no more. The book invites to breakfast.<br />
Wilt please your lordship enter?&mdash;Noble lady!<br />
[<i>Exeunt all except</i> <span class="smcap">Charlemont</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Castabella</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> My noble mistress, this accompliment<br />
Is like an elegant and moving speech,<br />
Composed of many sweet persuasive points,<br />
Which second one another, with a fluent<br />
Increase and confirmation of their force,<br />
Reserving still the best until the last,<br />
To crown the strong impulsion of the rest<br />
With a full conquest of the hearer's sense;<br />
Because the impression of the last we speak<br />
Doth always longest and most constantly<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>Possess the entertainment of remembrance.<br />
So all that now salute my taking leave<br />
Have added numerously to the love<br />
Wherewith I did receive their courtesy.<br />
But you, dear mistress, being the last and best<br />
That speaks my farewell, like the imperious close<br />
Of a most sweet oration, wholly have<br />
Possessed my liking, and shall ever live<br />
Within the soul of my true memory.<br />
So, mistress, with this kiss I take my leave.<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> My worthy servant, you mistake the intent<br />
Of kissing. 'Twas not meant to separate<br />
A pair of lovers, but to be the seal<br />
Of love; importing by the joining of<br />
Our mutual and incorporated breaths,<br />
That we should breathe but one contracted life.<br />
Or stay at home, or let me go with you.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> My Castabella, for myself to stay,<br />
Or you to go, would either tax my youth<br />
With a dishonourable weakness, or<br />
Your loving purpose with immodesty.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Languebeau Snuffe</span>.</p></blockquote>

And, for the satisfaction of your love,<br />
Here comes a man whose knowledge I have made<br />
A witness to the contract of our vows,<br />
Which my return, by marriage, shall confirm.<br />

<p><i>Lang.</i> I salute you both with the spirit of copulation,
already informed of your matrimonial purposes,

My faithful servant, did you never hear<br />
That when a certain great man went to the war,<br />
The lovely face of Heaven was masqued with sorrow,<br />
The sighing winds did move the breast of earth,<br />
The heavy clouds hung down their mourning heads,<br />
And wept sad showers the day that he went hence<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>As if that day presaged some ill success<br />
That fatally should kill his happiness.<br />
And so it came to pass. Methinks my eyes<br />
(Sweet Heaven forbid!) are like those weeping clouds,<br />
And as their showers presaged, so do my tears.<br />
Some sad event will follow my sad fears.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> Fie, superstitious! Is it bad to kiss?<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> May all my fears hurt me no more than this!<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> Fie, fie, fie! these carnal kisses do stir up
the concupiscences of the flesh.</p>

Her power to speak is perished in her tears.<br />
Something within me would persuade my stay,<br />
But reputation will not yield unto't.<br />
Dear sir, you are the man whose honest trust<br />
My confidence hath chosen for my friend.<br />
I fear my absence will discomfort her.<br />
You have the power and opportunity<br />
To moderate her passion. Let her grief<br />
Receive that friendship from you, and your love<br />
Shall not repent itself of courtesy.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> Sir, I want words and protestation to
insinuate into your credit; but in plainness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
truth, I will qualify her grief with the spirit of
consolation.</p>

Your interest shall exceed your principal. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<p><i>D'Am.</i> Monsieur Languebeau! happily encountered.
The honesty of your conversation makes
me request more interest in your familiarity.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> If your lordship will be pleased to salute
me without ceremony, I shall be willing to exchange
my service for your favour; but this worshipping
kind of entertainment is a superstitious vanity; in
plainness and truth, I love it not.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> I embrace your disposition, and desire to
give you as liberal assurance of my love as my Lord
Belforest, your deserved favourer.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> His lordship is pleased with my plainness
and truth of conversation.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> It cannot displease him. In the behaviour
of his noble daughter Castabella a man may read
her worth and your instruction.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> That gentlewoman is most sweetly modest,
fair, honest, handsome, wise, well-born, and rich.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> You have given me her picture in small.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> She's like your diamond; a temptation in
every man's eye, yet not yielding to any light impression
herself.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> The praise is hers, but the comparison
your own. [<i>Gives him the ring.</i></p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> You shall forgive me that, sir.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> I will not do so much at your request as
forgive you it. I will only give you it, sir. By &mdash;&mdash; you
will make me swear.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> O! by no means. Profane not your lips
with the foulness of that sin. I will rather take it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
To save your oath, you shall lose your ring.&mdash;Verily,
my lord, my praise came short of her worth. She
exceeds a jewel. This is but only for ornament: she
both for ornament and use.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> Yet unprofitably kept without use. She
deserves a worthy husband, sir. I have often wished
a match between my elder son and her. The marriage
would join the houses of Belforest and
D'Amville into a noble alliance.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> And the unity of families is a work of love and charity.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> And that work an employment well becoming
the goodness of your disposition.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> If your lordship please to impose it upon
me I will carry it without any second end; the surest
way to satisfy your wish.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> Most joyfully accepted. Rousard! Here
are letters to my Lord Belforest, touching my desire
to that purpose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rousard</span>, <i>looking sickly</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rousard, I send you a suitor to Castabella. To
this gentleman's discretion I commit the managing
of your suit. His good success shall be most thankful
to your trust. Follow his instructions; he will
be your leader.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> In plainness and truth.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> My leader! Does your lordship think me
too weak to give the onset myself?</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> I will only assist your proceedings.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> To say true, so I think you had need; for a sick
man can hardly get a woman's good will without help.</p>

<p>
<i>Lang.</i> Charlemont, thy gratuity and my promises were both<br />
But words, and both, like words, shall vanish into air.<br />
For thy poor empty hand I must be mute;<br />
This gives me feeling of a better suit.<br />

<i>D'Am.</i> Borachio, didst precisely note this man?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> His own profession would report him pure.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> And seems to know if any benefit<br />
Arises of religion after death.<br />
Yet but compare's profession with his life;&mdash;<br />
They so directly contradict themselves,<br />
As if the end of his instructions were<br />
But to divert the world from sin, that he<br />
More easily might ingross it to himself.<br />
By that I am confirmed an atheist.<br />
Well! Charlemont is gone; and here thou seest<br />
His absence the foundation of my plot.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> He is the man whom Castabella loves.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> That was the reason I propounded him<br />
Employment, fixed upon a foreign place,<br />
To draw his inclination out o' the way.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> It has left the passage of our practice free.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> This Castabella is a wealthy heir;<br />
And by her marriage with my elder son<br />
My house is honoured and my state increased.<br />
This work alone deserves my industry;<br />
But if it prosper, thou shalt see my brain<br />
Make this but an induction to a point<br />
So full of profitable policy,<br />
That it would make the soul of honesty<br />
Ambitious to turn villain.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> I bespeak<br />
Employment in't. I'll be an instrument<br />
To grace performance with dexterity.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Thou shalt. No man shall rob thee of the honour.<br />
Go presently and buy a crimson scarf<br />
Like Charlemont's: prepare thee a disguise<br />
I' the habit of a soldier, hurt and lame;<br />
And then be ready at the wedding feast,<br />
Where thou shalt have employment in a work<br />
Will please thy disposition.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span><br />
<i>Bor.</i> As I vowed,<br />
Your instrument shall make your project proud.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> This marriage will bring wealth. If that succeed,<br />
I will increase it though my brother bleed.<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Castabella</span> <i>avoiding the importunity of</i>
<span class="smcap">Rousard</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Nay, good sir; in troth, if you knew how
little it pleases me, you would forbear it.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> I will not leave thee till thou'st entertained
me for thy servant.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> My servant! You are sick you say. You
would tax me of indiscretion to entertain one that is
not able to do me service.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> The service of a gentlewoman consists most
in chamber work, and sick men are fittest for the
chamber. I prithee give me a favour.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Methinks you have a very sweet favour of
your own.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> I lack but your black eye.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> If you go to buffets among the boys, they'll
give you one.</p>

<p>
<i>Rous.</i> Nay, if you grow bitter I'll dispraise your black eye.<br />
The gray-eyed morning makes the fairest day.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Now that you dissemble not, I could be
willing to give you a favour. What favour would
you have?</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> Any toy, any light thing.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Fie! Will you be so uncivil to ask a light
thing at a gentlewoman's hand?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> Wilt give me a bracelet o' thy hair then?</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Do you want hair, sir.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> No, faith, I'll want no hair, so long as I
can have it for money.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> What would you do with my hair then?</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> Wear it for thy sake, sweetheart.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Do you think I love to have my hair worn off?</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> Come, you are so witty now and so sensible.
[<i>Kisses her.</i></p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Tush, I would I wanted one o' my senses now!</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> Bitter again? What's that? Smelling?</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> No, no, no. Why now y'are satisfied, I
hope. I have given you a favour.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> What favour? A kiss? I prithee give me another.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Show me that I gave it you then.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> How should I show it?</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> You are unworthy of a favour if you will not
bestow the keeping of it one minute.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> Well, in plain terms, dost love me? That's
the purpose of my coming.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Love you? Yes, very well.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> Give me thy hand upon't.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Nay, you mistake me. If I love you very
well I must not love you now. For now y'are not
very well, y'are sick.</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> This equivocation is for the jest now.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> I speak't as 'tis now in fashion, in earnest.
But I shall not be in quiet for you, I perceive, till I
have given you a favour. Do you love me?</p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> With all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Then with all my heart I'll give you a jewel
to hang in your ear.&mdash;Hark ye&mdash;I can never love
you. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Rous.</i> Call you this a jewel to hang in mine ear?
'Tis no light favour, for I'll be sworn it comes somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
heavily to me. Well, I will not leave her for
all this. Methinks it animates a man to stand to't,
when a woman desires to be rid of him at the first
sight. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Bel.</i> I entertain the offer of this match<br />
With purpose to confirm it presently.<br />
I have already moved it to my daughter.<br />
Her soft excuses savoured at the first,<br />
Methought, but of a modest innocence<br />
Of blood, whose unmoved stream was never drawn<br />
Into the current of affection. But when I<br />
Replied with more familiar arguments,<br />
Thinking to make her apprehension bold,&mdash;<br />
Her modest blush fell to a pale dislike;<br />
And she refused it with such confidence,<br />
As if she had been prompted by a love<br />
Inclining firmly to some other man;<br />
And in that obstinacy she remains.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> Verily, that disobedience doth not become a
child. It proceedeth from an unsanctified liberty. You
will be accessory to your own dishonour if you suffer it.</p>

<p>
<i>Bel.</i> Your honest wisdom has advised me well.<br />
Once more I'll move her by persuasive means.<br />
If she resist, all mildness set apart,<br />
I will make use of my authority.<br />
<br />
<i>Lang.</i> And instantly, lest fearing your constraint<br />
Her contrary affection teach her some<br />
Device that may prevent you.<br />

Procrastination may assist her with<br />
This instant night she shall be married.<br />

Commit the contract of his love and mine;<br />
Which now so strong a hand seeks to divide,<br />
That if your grave advice assist me not,<br />
I shall be forced to violate my faith.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> Since Charlemont's absence I have weighed
his love with the spirit of consideration; and in
sincerity I find it to be frivolous and vain. Withdraw
your respect; his affection deserveth it not.</p>

<p>
<i>Cast.</i> Good sir, I know your heart cannot profane<br />
The holiness you make profession of<br />
With such a vicious purpose as to break<br />
The vow your own consent did help to make.<br />
<br />
<i>Lang.</i> Can he deserve your love who in neglect<br />
Of your delightful conversation and<br />
In obstinate contempt of all your prayers<br />
And tears, absents himself so far from your<br />
Sweet fellowship, and with a purpose so<br />
Contracted to that absence that you see<br />
He purchases your separation with<br />
The hazard of his blood and life, fearing to want<br />
Pretence to part your companies.&mdash;<br />
'Tis rather hate that doth division move.<br />
Love still desires the presence of his love.&mdash;<br />
Verily he is not of the family of love.<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> O do not wrong him! 'Tis a generous mind<br />
That led his disposition to the war:<br />
For gentle love and noble courage are<br />
So near allied, that one begets another;<br />
Or Love is sister and Courage is the brother.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>Could I affect him better then before,<br />

Before the sweet possession of a man;<br />
The barren mind before the fruitful body,<br />
Where our creation has no reference<br />

Only for generation; which (unless<br />
Our children can be gotten by conceit)<br />
Must from the body come? If Reason were<br />
Our counsellor, we would neglect the work<br />
Of generation for the prodigal<br />
Expense it draws us to of that which is<br />
The wealth of life. Wise Nature, therefore, hath<br />
Reserved for an inducement to our sense<br />

<p><i>Sebas.</i> And verify the proverb&mdash;The nearer the
church the further from God.&mdash;Poor wench! For
thy sake may his hability die in his appetite, that
thou beest not troubled with him thou lovest not!
May his appetite move thy desire to another man, so
he shall help to make himself cuckold! And let that
man be one that he pays wages to; so thou shalt
profit by him thou hatest. Let the chambers be
matted, the hinges oiled, the curtain rings silenced,
and the chambermaid hold her peace at his own
request, that he may sleep the quieter; and in that
sleep let him be soundly cuckolded. And when he
knows it, and seeks to sue a divorce, let him have no
other satisfaction than this: He lay by and slept:
the law will take no hold of her because he winked
at it. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

The enemy.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a><br />

<i>Bor.</i> 'Tis very true, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Bel.</i> Canst thou relate it?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Yes.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> I prithee do.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> The enemy, defeated of a fair<br />
Advantage by a flatt'ring stratagem,<br />
Plants all the artillery against the town;<br />
Whose thunder and lightning made our bulwarks shake,<br />
And threatened in that terrible report<br />
The storm wherewith they meant to second it.<br />
The assault was general. But, for the place<br />
That promised most advantage to be forced,<br />
The pride of all their army was drawn forth<br />
And equally divided into front<br />
And rear. They marched, and coming to a stand,<br />
Ready to pass our channel at an ebb,<br />
We advised it for our safest course, to draw<br />
Our sluices up and mak't impassable.<br />
Our governor opposed and suffered them<br />
To charge us home e'en to the rampier's foot.<br />
But when their front was forcing up our breach<br />
At push o' pike, then did his policy<br />
Let go the sluices, and tripped up the heels<br />
Of the whole body of their troop that stood<br />
Within the violent current of the stream.<br />
Their front, beleaguered 'twixt the water and<br />
The town, seeing the flood was grown too deep<br />
To promise them a safe retreat, exposed<br />
The force of all their spirits (like the last<br />
Expiring gasp of a strong-hearted man)<br />
Upon the hazard of one charge, but were<br />
Oppressed, and fell. The rest that could not swim<br />
Were only drowned; but those that thought to 'scape<br />
By swimming, were by murderers that flanked<br />
The level of the flood, both drowned and slain.<br />
</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> Now, by my soul, soldier, a brave service.</p>

<p>
<i>Bor.</i> Walking next day upon the fatal shore,<br />
Among the slaughtered bodies of their men<br />
Which the full-stomached sea had cast upon<br />
The sands, it was my unhappy chance to light<br />
Upon a face, whose favour<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> when it lived,<br />
My astonished mind informed me I had seen.<br />
He lay in's armour, as if that had been<br />
His coffin; and the weeping sea, like one<br />
Whose milder temper doth lament the death<br />
Of him whom in his rage he slew, runs up<br />
The shore, embraces him, kisses his cheek,<br />
Goes back again, and forces up the sands<br />
To bury him, and every time it parts<br />
Sheds tears upon him, till at last (as if<br />
It could no longer endure to see the man<br />
Whom it had slain, yet loth to leave him) with<br />
A kind of unresolved unwilling pace,<br />
Winding her waves one in another, like<br />
A man that folds his arms or wrings his hands<br />
For grief, ebbed from the body, and descends<br />
As if it would sink down into the earth,<br />
And hide itself for shame of such a deed.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a><br />

Of comfort. My turn will be next. I feel<br />

<p><i>Lang.</i> All men are mortal. The hour of death is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
uncertain. Age makes sickness the more dangerous,

how soon you may be deprived of the benefit of
sense. In my understanding, therefore,<br />
You shall do well if you be sick to set<br />
Your state in present order. Make your will.<br />

Mine eye-balls and let envious Fortune play<br />
At tennis with 'em. Have I lived to this?<br />
Malicious Nature, hadst thou borne me blind,<br />
Thou hadst yet been something favourable to me.<br />

Not one poor spark in the whole spacious sky<br />
Of all that endless number would vouchsafe<br />
To shine?&mdash;You viceroys to the king of Nature,<br />
Whose constellations govern mortal births,<br />
Where is that fatal planet ruled at his<br />
Nativity? that might ha' pleased to light him out,<br />

Lament him not. Whether our deaths be good<br />

He lived well; therefore, questionless, well dies.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Ay, 'tis an easy thing for him that has<br />
No pain, to talk of patience. Do you think<br />
That Nature has no feeling?<br />
<br />
<i>Bel.</i> Feeling? Yes.<br />
But has she purposed anything for nothing?<br />
What good receives this body by your grief?<br />
Whether is't more unnatural, not to grieve<br />
For him you cannot help with it, or hurt<br />
Yourself with grieving, and yet grieve in vain?<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Indeed, had he been taken from me like<br />
A piece o' dead flesh, I should neither ha' felt it<br />
Nor grieved for't. But come hither, pray look here.<br />
Behold the lively tincture of his blood!<br />
Neither the dropsy nor the jaundice in't,<br />
But the true freshness of a sanguine red,<br />
For all the fog of this black murderous night<br />
Has mixed with it. For anything I know<br />
He might ha' lived till doomsday, and ha' done<br />
More good than either you or I. O brother!<br />
He was a man of such a native goodness,<br />
As if regeneration had been given<br />
Him in his mother's womb. So harmless<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>That rather than ha' trod upon a worm<br />
He would ha' shunned the way.<br />
So dearly pitiful that ere the poor<br />
Could ask his charity with dry eyes he gave 'em<br />
Relief with tears&mdash;with tears&mdash;yes, faith, with tears.<br />
<br />
<i>Bel.</i> Take up the corpse. For wisdom's sake let reason fortify this weakness.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Why, what would you ha' me do? Foolish Nature<br />
Will have her course in spite o' wisdom. But<br />
I have e'en done. All these words were<br />
But a great wind; and now this shower of tears<br />
Has laid it, I am calm again. You may<br />
Set forward when you will. I'll follow you<br />
Like one that must and would not.<br />
<br />
<i>Lang.</i> Our opposition will but trouble him.<br />

<i>D'Am.</i> O my echo! I could stand<br />
Reverberating this sweet musical air<br />
Of joy till I had perished my sound lungs<br />
With violent laughter. Lonely night-raven,<br />
Thou hast seized a carcase.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Put him out on's pain.<br />
I lay so fitly underneath the bank,<br />
From whence he fell, that ere his faltering tongue<br />
Could utter double O, I knocked out's brains<br />
With this fair ruby, and had another stone,<br />
Just of this form and bigness, ready; that<br />
I laid i' the broken skull upon the ground<br />

The brain of man was e'er delivered of.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Ay, mark the plot. Not any circumstance<br />
That stood within the reach of the design<br />
Of persons, dispositions, matter, time, or place<br />
But by this brain of mine was made<br />
An instrumental help; yet nothing from<br />
The induction to the accomplishment seemed forced,<br />
Or done o' purpose, but by accident.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> First, my report that Charlemont was dead,<br />
Though false, yet covered with a mask of truth.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Ay, and delivered in as fit a time<br />
When all our minds so wholly were possessed<br />
With one affair, that no man would suspect<br />
A thought employed for any second end.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Then the precisian<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> to be ready, when<br />
Your brother spake of death, to move his will.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> His business called him thither, and it fell<br />
Within his office unrequested to't.<br />
From him it came religiously, and saved<br />
Our project from suspicion which if I<br />
Had moved, had been endangered.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Then your healths,<br />
Though seeming but the ordinary rites<br />
And ceremonies due to festivals&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Yet used by me to make the servants drunk,<br />
An instrument the plot could not have missed.<br />
'Twas easy to set drunkards by the ears,<br />
They'd nothing but their torches to fight with,<br />
And when those lights were out&mdash;<br />
<br />

Protect the execution of the work<br />
Both from prevention and discovery.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span><br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Here was a murder bravely carried through<br />
The eye of observation, unobserved.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> And those that saw the passage of it made<br />
The instruments, yet knew not what they did.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> That power of rule philosophers ascribe<br />
To him they call the Supreme of the stars<br />
Making their influences governors<br />
Of sublunary creatures, when themselves<br />
Are senseless of their operations.<br />
What! [<i>Thunder and lightning.</i><br />
Dost start at thunder? Credit my belief<br />
'Tis a mere effect of Nature&mdash;an exhalation hot<br />
And dry involved within a watery vapour<br />
I' the middle region of the air; whose coldness,<br />
Congealing that thick moisture to a cloud,<br />
The angry exhalation, shut within<br />
A prison of contrary quality,<br />
Strives to be free and with the violent<br />
Eruption through the grossness of that cloud,<br />
Makes this noise we hear.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> 'Tis a fearful noise.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> 'Tis a brave noise, and methinks<br />
Graces our accomplished project as<br />
A peal of ordnance does a triumph. It speaks<br />
Encouragement. Now Nature shows thee how<br />
It favoured our performance, to forbear<br />
This noise when we set forth, because it should<br />
Not terrify my brother's going home,<br />
Which would have dashed our purpose,&mdash;to forbear<br />
This lightning in our passage lest it should<br />
Ha' warned him o' the pitfall.<br />
Then propitious Nature winked<br />
At our proceedings: now it doth express<br />
How that forbearance favoured our success.<br />

That Nature, since herself decay doth hate,<br />

You have dispossessed him, countenance the act.<br />
Spare so much out of that to give him a<br />

His death appear more confident and true.<br />

<p>
<i>Lev.</i> Thou art welcome into my chamber, Fresco.<br />
Prithee shut the door.&mdash;Nay; thou mistakest me.<br />
Come in and shut it.<br />
<br />
<i>Free.</i> 'Tis somewhat late, madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Lev.</i> No matter. I have somewhat to say to thee.<br />
What, is not thy mistress towards a husband yet?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> Faith, madam, she has suitors, but they will
not suit her, methinks. They will not come off
lustily, it seems.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> They will not come on lustily, thou wouldst
say.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> I mean, madam they are not rich enough.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> But ay, Fresco, they are not bold enough.
Thy mistress is of a lively attractive blood, Fresco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
and in truth she is of my mind for that. A poor
spirit is poorer than a poor purse. Give me a fellow
that brings not only temptation with him, but has
the activity of wit and audacity of spirit to apply
every word and gesture of a woman's speech and
behaviour to his own desire, and make her believe she's
the suitor herself; never give back till he has made
her yield to it.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> Indeed among our equals, madam; but
otherwise we shall be put horribly out o' countenance.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> Thou art deceived, Fresco. Ladies are as
courteous as yeomen's wives, and methinks they
should be more gentle. Hot diet and soft ease
makes 'em like wax always kept warm, more easy to
take impression.&mdash;Prithee, untie my shoe.&mdash;What, art
thou shamefaced too? Go roundly to work, man.
My leg is not gouty: 'twill endure the feeling, I
warrant thee. Come hither, Fresco; thine ear.
S'dainty, I mistook the place, I missed thine ear and
hit thy lip.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> Your ladyship has made me blush.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> That shows thou art full o' lusty blood and thou
knowest not how to use it. Let me see thy hand.
Thou shouldst not be shamefaced by thy hand, Fresco.
Here's a brawny flesh and a hairy skin, both signs
of an able body. I do not like these phlegmatic,
smooth-skinned, soft-fleshed fellows. They are like
candied suckets<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> when they begin to perish, which I
would always empty my closet of, and give 'em my
chambermaid.&mdash;I have some skill in palmistry: by
this line that stands directly against me thou shouldst
be near a good fortune, Fresco, if thou hadst the
grace to entertain it.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> O what is that, madam, I pray?</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> No less than the love of a fair lady, if thou
dost not lose her with faint-heartedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> A lady, madam? Alas, a lady is a great
thing: I cannot compass her.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> No? Why, I am a lady. Am I so great I
cannot be compassed? Clasp my waist, and try.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> I could find i' my heart, madam&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Sebastian</span>

I'll write a word or two i' your behalf.</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> A word or two, madam? That you do for
me will not be contained in less than the compass of
two sheets. But in plain terms shall we take the
opportunity of privateness.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> What to do?</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> To dance the beginning of the world after
the English manner.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> Why not after the French or Italian?</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> Fie! they dance it preposterously;
backward!</p>

one at the door has beaten opportunity away from
us. In brief, I love thee, and it shall not be long
before I give thee a testimony of it. To save thee
now from suspicion do no more but draw thy rapier,

taking notice of him. Only seem to be angry,

Be patient a little, sweet husband: tarry but till my

<p><i>Bel.</i> What ails Sebastian? He looks so distractedly.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> The poor gentleman's almost out on's wits, I
think. You remember the displeasure his father took
against him about the liberty of speech he used even
now, when your daughter went to be married?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Yes. What of that?</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> 'T has crazed him sure. He met a poor man
i' the street even now. Upon what quarrel I know
not, but he pursued him so violently that if my house
had not been his rescue he had surely killed him.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> What a strange desperate young man is that!</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> Nay, husband, he grew so in rage, when he
saw the man was conveyed from him, that he was
ready even to have drawn his naked weapon upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
me. And had not your knocking at the door prevented
him, surely he'd done something to me.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Where's the man?</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> Alas, here! I warrant you the poor fearful
soul is scarce come to himself again yet.&mdash;If the fool
have any wit he will apprehend me. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Do
you hear, sir? You may be bold to come forth: the
fury that haunted you is gone.
[<span class="smcap">Fresco</span> <i>peeps fearfully forth from behind the arras.</i></p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> Are you sure he is gone?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> He's gone, he's gone, I warrant thee.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> I would I were gone too. H's shook me
almost into a dead palsy.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> How fell the difference between you?</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> I would I were out at the back door.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Thou art safe enough. Prithee tell's the falling out.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> Yes, sir, when I have recovered my spirits.
My memory is almost frighted from me.&mdash;Oh, so, so,
so!&mdash;Why, sir, as I came along the street, sir&mdash;this
same gentleman came stumbling after me and trod
o' my heel.&mdash;I cried O. Do you cry, sirrah? says
he. Let me see your heel; if it be not hurt I'll
make you cry for something. So he claps my head
between his legs and pulls off my shoe. I having
shifted no socks in a sen'night, the gentleman cried
foh! and said my feet were base and cowardly feet,
they stunk for fear. Then he knocked my shoe
about my pate, and I cried O once more. In the
meantime comes a shag-haired dog by, and rubs
against his shins. The gentleman took the dog in
shag-hair to be some watchman in a rug gown, and
swore he would hang me up at the next door with
my lanthorn in my hand, that passengers might see
their way as they went, without rubbing against
gentlemen's shins. So, for want of a cord, he took
his own garters off, and as he was going to make a
noose, I watched my time and ran away. And as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
ran, indeed I bid him hang himself in his own
garters. So he, in choler, pursued me hither, as
you see.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Why, this savours of distraction.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> Of mere distraction.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> Howsover it savours, I am sure it smells like
a lie. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Thou may'st go forth at the back door, honest
fellow; the way is private and safe.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> So it had need, for your fore-door here is
both common and dangerous. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Belforest</span>.</p>

Impressions of premeditated things<br />
By serious apprehension left upon<br />
Our minds; or else the imaginary shapes<br />
Of objects proper to the complexion, or<br />
The dispositions of our bodies. These<br />
Can neither of them be the cause why I<br />
Should dream thus; for my mind has not been moved<br />
With any one conception of a thought<br />
To such a purpose; nor my nature wont<br />
To trouble me with fantasies of terror.<br />
It must be something that my Genius would<br />
Inform me of. Now gracious Heaven forbid!<br />
Oh! let my spirit be deprived of all<br />
Foresight and knowledge, ere it understand<br />
That vision acted, or divine that act<br />
To come. Why should I think so? Left I not<br />

<i>Sol.</i> You dream,<br />
Sir. I saw nothing.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> Tush! these idle dreams<br />
Are fabulous. Our boyling fantasies<br />
Like troubled waters falsify the shapes<br />
Of things retained in them, and make 'em seem<br />
Confounded when they are distinguished. So,<br />
My actions daily conversant with war,<br />
The argument of blood and death had left<br />
Perhaps the imaginary presence of<br />
Some bloody accident upon my mind,<br />
Which, mixed confusedly with other thoughts,<br />
Whereof the remembrance of my father might<br />
Be one presented, all together seem<br />
Incorporate, as if his body were<br />
The owner of that blood, the subject of<br />
That death, when he's at Paris and that blood<br />
Shed here. It may be thus. I would not leave<br />
The war, for reputation's sake, upon<br />
An idle apprehension, a vain dream.<br />

lies in prison for a thousand crowns. Honesty tells
me 'twere well done to release Charlemont. But
discretion says I had much ado to come by this, and
when this shall be gone I know not where to finger
any more, especially if I employ it to this use, which
is like to endanger me into my father's perpetual
displeasure. And then I may go hang myself, or be
forced to do that will make another save me the
labour. No matter, Charlemont, thou gavest me my
life, and that's somewhat of a purer earth than gold,
fine as it is. 'Tis no courtesy, I do thee but thankfulness.
I owe it thee, and I'll pay it. He fought
bravely, but the officers dragged him villanously.
Arrant knaves! for using him so discourteously;
may the sins o' the poor people be so few that you
sha' not be able to spare so much out of your gettings
as will pay for the hire of a lame starved hackney to
ride to an execution, but go a-foot to the gallows and
be hanged. May elder brothers turn good husbands,
and younger brothers get good wives, that there be
no need of debt books nor use of serjeants. May
there be all peace, but i' the war and all charity, but
i' the devil, so that prisons may be turned to hospitals,
though the officers live o' the benevolence. If this
curse might come to pass, the world would say,
"Blessed be he that curseth." [<i>Exit.</i></p>

As high as justice, an essential part<br />
Of his unbounded goodness, whose divine<br />
Impression, form, and image man should bear!<br />
And, methinks, man should love to imitate<br />
His mercy, since the only countenance<br />

Not mediate between it and our weakness.<br />

Are nearer heaven in place, be nearer it<br />
In goodness. Rich men should transcend the poor<br />
As clouds the earth, raised by the comfort of<br />
The sun to water dry and barren grounds.<br />
If neither the impression in your soul<br />
Of goodness, nor the duty of your place<br />
As goodness' substitute can move you, then<br />
Let nature, which in savages, in beasts,<br />
Can stir to pity, tell you that he is<br />

For with the hand of our whole family<br />
We interchange the indenture<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> of our loves.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span><br />
<i>Charl.</i> And I accept it. Yet not so joyfully<br />
Because y'are sick.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Sir, his affection's sound<br />
Though he be sick in body.<br />
<br />
<i>Rous.</i> Sick indeed.<br />
A general weakness did surprise my health<br />
The very day I married Castabella,<br />
As if my sickness were a punishment<br />
That did arrest me for some injury<br />
I then committed. Credit me, my love,<br />
I pity thy ill fortune to be matched<br />
With such a weak, unpleasing bedfellow.<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> Believe me, sir, it never troubles me.<br />
I am as much respectless to enjoy<br />
Such pleasure, as ignorant what it is.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> Thy sex's wonder. Unhappy Charlemont!<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Come, let's to supper. There we will confirm<br />
The eternal bond of our concluded love. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH.</h3>

<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Cataplasma's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cataplasma</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Soquette</span> <i>with needlework.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cata.</i> Come, Soquette,
your work! let's examine your
work. What's here? a medlar
with a plum tree growing hard by
it; the leaves o' the plum tree
falling off; the gum issuing out
o' the perished joints; and the
branches some of 'em dead, and some rotten; and
yet but a young plum tree. In good sooth very
pretty.</p>

<p><i>Soqu.</i> The plum tree, forsooth, grows so near the
medlar that the medlar sucks and draws all the sap
from it and the natural strength o' the ground, so
that it cannot prosper.</p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> How conceited you are!<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> But here th'ast
made a tree to bear no fruit. Why's that?</p>

<p><i>Soqu.</i> There grows a savin tree next it, forsooth.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> Forsooth you are a little too witty in that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sebastian</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> But this honeysuckle winds about this
white thorn very prettily and lovingly, sweet Mistress
Cataplasma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> Monsieur Sebastian! in good sooth very
uprightly welcome this evening.</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> What, moralizing upon this gentlewoman's
needlework? Let's see.</p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> No, sir. Only examining whether it be
done to the true nature and life o' the thing.</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> Here y' have set a medlar with a bachelor's
button o' one side and a snail o' the tother. The
bachelor's button should have held his head up more
pertly towards the medlar: the snail o' the tother side
should ha' been wrought with an artificial laziness,
doubling his tail and putting out his horn but half
the length. And then the medlar falling (as it were)
from the lazy snail and ending towards the pert
bachelor's button, their branches spreading and
winding one within another as if they did embrace.
But here's a moral. A poppring<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> pear tree growing
upon the bank of a river seeming continually to
look downwards into the water as if it were
enamoured of it, and ever as the fruit ripens lets it
fall for love (as it were) into her lap. Which the
wanton stream, like a strumpet, no sooner receives
but she carries it away and bestows it upon some
other creature she maintains, still seeming to play
and dally under the poppring so long that it has
almost washed away the earth from the root, and
now the poor tree stands as if it were ready to fall
and perish by that whereon it spent all the substance
it had.</p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> Moral for you that love those wanton running
waters.</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> But is not my Lady Levidulcia come yet?</p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> Her purpose promised us her company ere
this. Sirrah, your lute and your book.</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> Well said. A lesson o' the lute, to entertain
the time with till she comes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cata. Sol, fa, mi, la.&mdash;Mi, mi, mi.</i>&mdash;Precious!
Dost not see <i>mi</i> between the two crotchets? Strike
me full there.&mdash;So&mdash;forward. This is a sweet
strain, and thou finger'st it beastly. <i>Mi</i> is a <i>laerg</i><a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
there, and the prick that stands before <i>mi</i> a long;
always halve your note.&mdash;Now&mdash;Run your
division pleasingly with these quavers. Observe all
your graces i' the touch.&mdash;Here's a sweet close&mdash;strike
it full; it sets off your music delicately.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Languebeau Snuffe</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Levidulcia</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lang.</i> Purity be in this house.</p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> 'Tis now entered; and welcome with your
good ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> Cease that music. Here's a sweeter instrument.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> Restrain your liberty. See you not Snuffe?</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> What does the stinkard here? put Snuffe
out. He's offensive.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> No. The credit of his company defends my
being abroad from the eye of suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> Wilt please your ladyship go up into the
closet? There are those falls and tires<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> I told you of.</p>

<p><i>Lev.</i> Monsieur Snuffe, I shall request your patience.
My stay will not be long. [<i>Exit with</i> <span class="smcap">Sebastian</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> My duty, madam.&mdash;Falls and tires! I
begin to suspect what falls and tires you mean. My
lady and Sebastian the fall and the tire, and I the
shadow. I perceive the purity of my conversation is
used but for a property to cover the uncleanness of their
purposes. The very contemplation o' the thing makes
the spirit of the flesh begin to wriggle in my blood.
And here my desire has met with an object already.
This gentlewoman, methinks, should be swayed with
the motion, living in a house where moving example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
is so common.&mdash;Mistress Cataplasma, my lady, it
seems, has some business that requires her stay.
The fairness o' the evening invites me into the air.
Will it please you give this gentlewoman leave to
leave her work and walk a turn or two with me for
honest recreation?</p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> With all my heart, sir. Go, Soquette: give
ear to his instructions. You may get understanding
by his company, I can tell you.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> In the way of holiness, Mistress Cataplasma.</p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> Good Monsieur Snuffe!&mdash;I will attend your
return.</p>

<p>
<i>Lang.</i> Your hand, gentlewoman.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Soquette</span>.]<br />
The flesh is humble till the spirit move it.<br />
But when 'tis raised it will command above it.<br />
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>An Apartment in</i> <span class="smcap">D'Amville's</span> <i>Mansion.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">D'Amville, Charlemont</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Borachio</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>D'Am.</i> Your sadness and the sickness of my son<br />
Have made our company and conference<br />
Less free and pleasing than I purposed it.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> Sir, for the present I am much unfit<br />
For conversation or society.<br />
With pardon I will rudely take my leave.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Good night, dear nephew.<br />
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Charlemont</span>.<br />
Seest thou that same man?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Your meaning, sir?<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> That fellow's life, Borachio,<br />
Like a superfluous letter in the law,<br />
Endangers our assurance.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a><br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Scrape him out.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span><br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Wilt do't?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Give me your purpose&mdash;I will do't.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Sad melancholy has drawn Charlemont<br />
With meditation on his father's death<br />
Into the solitary walk behind the church.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> The churchyard? 'Tis the fittest place for death.<br />
Perhaps he's praying. Then he's fit to die.<br />
We'll send him charitably to his grave.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> No matter how thou tak'st him. First take this&mdash;<br />
[<i>Gives him a pistol.</i><br />
Thou knowest the place. Observe his passages,<br />
And with the most advantage make a stand,<br />
That, favoured by the darkness of the night,<br />
His breast may fall upon thee at so near<br />
A distance that he sha' not shun the blow.<br />
The deed once done, thou may'st retire with safety.<br />
The place is unfrequented, and his death<br />
Will be imputed to the attempt of thieves.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Be careless. Let your mind be free and clear.<br />
This pistol shall discharge you of your fear. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> But let me call my projects to account<br />
For what effect and end have I engaged<br />
Myself in all this blood? To leave a state<br />
To the succession of my proper blood.<br />
But how shall that succession be continued?<br />
Not in my elder son, I fear. Disease<br />
And weakness have disabled him for issue.<br />
For the other,&mdash;his loose humour will endure<br />
No bond of marriage. And I doubt his life,<br />
His spirit is so boldly dangerous.<br />
O pity that the profitable end<br />
Of such a prosperous murder should be lost!<br />
Nature forbid! I hope I have a body<br />
That will not suffer me to lose my labour<br />
For want of issue yet. But then't must be<br />
A bastard.&mdash;Tush! they only father bastards<br />
That father other men's begettings. Daughter!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>Be it mine own. Let it come whence it will,<br />
I am resolved. Daughter!<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> Servant.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ser.</i> My lord.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> I prithee call my daughter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Castabella</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Your pleasure, sir.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> Is thy husband i' bed?</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Yes, my lord.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> The evening's fair. I prithee walk a turn or two.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Come, Jaspar.</p>

<p>
<i>D'Am.</i> No.<br />
We'll walk but to the corner o' the church;<br />
And I have something to speak privately.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> No matter; stay. [<i>Exit</i> Servant.</p>

<p><i>D'Am.</i> This falls out happily. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>The Churchyard.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charlemont.&mdash;Borachio</span> <i>dogging him.
The clock strikes twelve.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Charl.</i> Twelve.</p>

<p><i>Bor.</i> 'Tis a good hour: 'twill strike one anon.</p>

<p><i>Charl.</i> How fit a place for contemplation is this
dead of night, among the dwellings of the dead.&mdash;This
grave&mdash;Perhaps the inhabitant was in his lifetime
the possessor of his own desires. Yet in the
midst of all his greatness and his wealth he was less
rich and less contented than in this poor piece of
earth lower and lesser than a cottage. For here he
neither wants nor cares. Now that his body savours
of corruption<br />
He enjoys a sweeter rest than e'er he did<br />
Amongst the sweetest pleasures of this life,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>For here there's nothing troubles him.&mdash;And there<br />
&mdash;In that grave lies another. He, perhaps,<br />
Was in his life as full of misery<br />
As this of happiness. And here's an end<br />
Of both. Now both their states are equal. O<br />
That man with so much labour should aspire<br />
To worldly height, when in the humble earth<br />
The world's condition's at the best, or scorn<br />
Inferior men, since to be lower than<br />
A worm is to be higher than a king.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Then fall and rise.<br />
[<i>Discharges the pistol, which misses fire.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> What villain's hand was that?<br />
Save thee, or thou shalt perish. [<i>They fight.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Zounds! unsaved<br />
I think. [<i>Falls.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> What? Have I killed him? Whatsoe'er thou beest,<br />
I would thy hand had prospered. For I was<br />
Unfit to live and well prepared to die.<br />
What shall I do? Accuse myself? Submit<br />
Me to the law? And that will quickly end<br />
This violent increase of misery.<br />
But 'tis a murder to be accessory<br />
To mine own death. I will not. I will take<br />
This opportunity to 'scape. It may<br />
Be Heaven reserves me to some better end. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Languebeau Snuffe</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Soquette</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Soqu.</i> Nay, good sir, I dare not. In good sooth I
come of a generation both by father and mother that
were all as fruitful as costermongers' wives.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> Tush! then a tympany<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> is the greatest
danger can be feared. Their fruitfulness turns but
to a certain kind of phlegmatic windy disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Soqu.</i> I must put my understanding to your trust,
sir. I would be loth to be deceived.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> No, conceive thou sha't not. Yet thou
shalt profit by my instruction too. My body is not
every day drawn dry, wench.</p>

<p><i>Soqu.</i> Yet methinks, sir, your want of use should
rather make your body like a well,&mdash;the lesser 'tis
drawn, the sooner it grows dry.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> Thou shalt try that instantly.</p>

<p><i>Soqu.</i> But we want place and opportunity.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> We have both. This is the back side of
the house which the superstitious call St. Winifred's
church, and is verily a convenient unfrequented
place.&mdash;<br />
Where under the close curtains of the night&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Soqu.</i> You purpose i' the dark to make me light.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Snuffe</span>  <i>pulls out a sheet, a hair, and a beard.</i><br />
But what ha' you there?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> This disguise is for security's sake, wench.
There's a talk, thou know'st, that the ghost of old
Montferrers walks. In this church he was buried.
Now if any stranger fall upon us before our business
be ended, in this disguise I shall be taken for that
ghost, and never be called to examination, I warrant
thee. Thus we shall 'scape both prevention and
discovery. How do I look in this habit, wench?</p>

<p><i>Soqu.</i> So like a ghost that notwithstanding I have
some foreknowledge of you, you make my hair stand
almost on end.</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> I will try how I can kiss in this beard. O,
fie, fie, fie! I will put it off and then kiss, and then
put it on. I can do the rest without kissing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charlemont</span> <i>doubtfully, with his sword

<p>
<i>Charl.</i> What ha' we here? A sheet! a hair! a beard!<br />
What end was this disguise intended for?<br />
No matter what. I'll not expostulate<br />
The purpose of a friendly accident.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a><br />
Perhaps it may accommodate my 'scape.<br />
&mdash;I fear I am pursued. For more assurance,<br />
I'll hide me here i' th' charnel house,<br />
This convocation-house of dead men's skulls.<br />
[<i>In getting into the charnel house he takes hold of
a death's head; it slips, and he staggers.</i><br />

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">D'Amville</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Castabella</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Cast.</i> My lord, the night grows late. Your lordship spake<br />
Of something you desired to move in private.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Yes. Now I'll speak it. The argument is love.<br />
The smallest ornament of thy sweet form<br />
(That abstract of all pleasure) can command<br />
The senses into passion and thy entire<br />
Perfection is my object, yet I love thee<br />
With the freedom of my reason. I can give<br />
Thee reason for my love.<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> Love me, my lord?<br />
I do believe it, for I am the wife<br />
Of him you love.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> 'Tis true. By my persuasion thou wert forced<br />
To marry one unable to perform<br />
The office of a husband. I was the author<br />
Of the wrong.<br />
My conscience suffers under't, and I would<br />
Disburthen it by satisfaction.<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> How?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span><br />
<i>D'Am.</i> I will supply that pleasure to thee which he cannot.<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> Are ye a devil or a man?<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> A man, and such a man as can return<br />
Thy entertainment with as prodigal<br />
A body as the covetous desire,<br />
Or woman ever was delighted with.<br />
So that, besides the full performance of<br />
Thy empty husband's duty, thou shalt have<br />
The joy of children to continue the<br />
Succession of thy blood. For the appetite<br />
That steals her pleasure, draws the forces of<br />
The body to an united strength, and puts 'em<br />
Altogether into action, never fails<br />
Of procreation. All the purposes<br />
Of man aim but at one of these two ends&mdash;<br />
Pleasure or profit; and in this one sweet<br />
Conjunction of our loves they both will meet.<br />
Would it not grieve thee that a stranger to<br />
Thy blood should lay the first foundation of<br />
His house upon the ruins of thy family?<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> Now Heaven defend me! May my memory<br />
Be utterly extinguished, and the heir<br />
Of him that was my father's enemy<br />
Raise his eternal monument upon<br />
Our ruins, ere the greatest pleasure or<br />
The greatest profit ever tempt me to<br />
Continue it by incest.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Incest? Tush!<br />
These distances affinity observes<br />
Are articles of bondage cast upon<br />
Our freedoms by our own objections.<br />
Nature allows a general liberty<br />
Of generation to all creatures else.<br />
Shall man,<br />
To whose command and use all creatures were<br />
Made subject, be less free than they?<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> O God!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>Is Thy unlimited and infinite<br />
Omnipotence less free because thou doest<br />
No ill?<br />
Or if you argue merely out of nature,<br />
Do you not degenerate from that, and are<br />
You not unworthy the prerogative<br />
Of Nature's masterpiece, when basely you<br />
Prescribe yourself authority and law<br />
From their examples whom you should command?<br />
I could confute you, but the horror of<br />
The argument confutes my understanding.&mdash;<br />
Sir, I know you do but try me in<br />
Your son's behalf, suspecting that<br />
My strength<br />
And youth of blood cannot contain themselves<br />
With impotence.&mdash;Believe me, sir,<br />
I never wronged him. If it be your lust,<br />
O quench it on their prostituted flesh<br />
Whose trade of sin can please desire with more<br />
Delight and less offence.&mdash;The poison o' your breath,<br />
Evaporated from so foul a soul,<br />
Infects the air more than the damps that rise<br />
From bodies but half rotten in their graves.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Kiss me. I warrant thee my breath is sweet.<br />
These dead men's bones lie here of purpose to<br />
Invite us to supply the number of<br />
The living. Come we'll get young bones, and do't.<br />
I will enjoy thee. No? Nay then invoke<br />
Your great supposed protector; I will do't.<br />
<br />
<i>Cast.</i> Supposed protector! Are ye an atheist? Then<br />
I know my prayers and tears are spent in vain.<br />
O patient Heaven! Why dost thou not express<br />
Thy wrath in thunderbolts to tear the frame<br />
Of man in pieces? How can earth endure<br />
The burthen of this wickedness without<br />
An earthquake? Or the angry face of Heaven<br />

Of apprehension,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> that the law may make<br />

Killed a man; not murdered him, my Castabella.<br />
He would ha' murdered me.<br />

That wicked atheist! I suspect his plot.<br />

<p><i>Bel.</i> Is not my wife come in yet?</p>

<p><i>Ser.</i> No, my lord.</p>

<p>
<i>Bel.</i> Methinks she's very affectedly inclined<br />
To young Sebastian's company o' late.<br />
But jealousy is such a torment that<br />
I am afraid to entertain it. Yet<br />
The more I shun by circumstances to meet<br />
Directly with it, the more ground I find<br />
To circumvent my apprehension. First,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>I know she has a perpetual appetite,<br />
Which being so oft encountered with a man<br />
Of such a bold luxurious freedom as<br />
Sebastian is, and of so promising<br />
A body, her own blood corrupted will<br />
Betray her to temptation.<br />

<p><i>Bel.</i> Know not you the gentlewoman my wife

<p><i>Ser.</i> By sight, my lord. Her man was here but now.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Yes, faith, Fresco; e'en a wench o' the trade.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> O no, my lord. Those falling diseases cause
baldness, and my mistress recovers the loss of hair,
for she is a periwig maker.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> And nothing else?</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> Sells falls, and tires, and bodies for ladies,

<p><i>Bel.</i> So, sir; and she helps my lady to falls and
bodies now and then, does she not?</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> At her ladyship's pleasure, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Her pleasure, you rogue? You are the pander
to her pleasure, you varlet, are you not? You know
the conveyances between Sebastian and my wife?
Tell me the truth, or by this hand I'll nail thy bosom
to the earth. Stir not, you dog, but quickly tell the
truth.</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> O yes! [<i>Speaks like a crier.</i></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Is not thy mistress a bawd to my wife?</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> O yes!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> And acquainted with her tricks, and her plots,
and her devices?</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> O yes! If any man, o' court, city, or
country, has found my Lady Levidulcia in bed but
my Lord Belforest, it is Sebastian.</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> Mistress Soquette, a word with you.
[<i>Whispers.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Lev.</i> If he brings word my husband is i' bed<br />
I will adventure one night's liberty<br />
To be abroad.&mdash;<br />
My strange affection to this man!&mdash;'Tis like<br />
That natural sympathy which e'en among<br />
The senseless creatures of the earth commands<br />
A mutual inclination and consent.<br />
For though it seems to be the free effect<br />
Of mine own voluntary love, yet I can<br />
Neither restrain it nor give reason for't.<br />
But now 'tis done, and in your power it lies<br />
To save my honour, or dishonour me.<br />
<br />
<i>Cata.</i> Enjoy your pleasure, madam, without fear,<br />
I never will betray the trust you have<br />
Committed to me. And you wrong yourself<br />
To let consideration of the sin<br />
Molest your conscience. Methinks 'tis unjust<br />
That a reproach should be inflicted on<br />
A woman for offending but with one,<br />
When 'tis a light offence in husbands to<br />
Commit with many.<br />
<br />
<i>Lev.</i> So it seems to me.&mdash;<br />
Why, how now, Sebastian, making love to that
gentlewoman? How many mistresses ha' you i' faith?</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> In faith, none; for I think none of 'em are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
faithful; but otherwise, as many as clean shirts. The
love of a woman is like a mushroom,&mdash;it grows in
one night and will serve somewhat pleasingly next
morning to breakfast, but afterwards waxes fulsome
and unwholesome.</p>

<p><i>Cata.</i> Nay, by Saint Winifred, a woman's love
lasts as long as winter fruit.</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> 'Tis true&mdash;till new come in. By my
experience no longer.</p>

<p><i>Sebas.</i> Pay dear? For what?</p>

<p><i>Fres.</i> Will't not be a chargeable reckoning, think
you, when here are half a dozen fellows coming to call
us to account, with every man a several bill<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> in his

Neither can speak, yet both report my shame.<br />

Their blood runs out in rivers, and my lust<br />
The fountain whence it flows? Dear husband, let<br />
Not thy departed spirit be displeased<br />
If with adulterate lips I kiss thy cheek.<br />
Here I behold the hatefulness of lust,<br />
Which brings me kneeling to embrace him dead<br />
Whose body living I did loathe to touch.<br />
Now I can weep. But what can tears do good<br />
When I weep only water, they weep blood.<br />
But could I make an ocean with my tears<br />
That on the flood this broken vessel of<br />
My body, laden heavy with light lust,<br />
Might suffer shipwreck and so drown my shame.<br />
Then weeping were to purpose, but alas!<br />
The sea wants water enough to wash away<br />
The foulness of my name. O! in their wounds<br />
I feel my honour wounded to the death.<br />
Shall I out-live my honour? Must my life<br />
Be made the world's example? Since it must,<br />
Then thus in detestation of my deed,<br />
To make the example move more forceably<br />
To virtue, thus I seal it with a death<br />
As full of horror as my life of sin. [<i>Stabs herself.</i><br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>She cannot. Sure there is some power above<br />
Her that controls her force.<br />

Nature? Doubt you that, my lord? Consider but<br />
Whence man receives his body and his form.<br />
Not from corruption like some worms and flies,<br />
But only from the generation of<br />
A man. For Nature never did bring forth<br />
A man without a man; nor could the first<br />
Man, being but the passive subject, not<br />
The active mover, be the maker of<br />
Himself. So of necessity there must<br />
Be a superior power to Nature.<br />
<br />
<i>D'Am.</i> Now to myself I am ridiculous.<br />
Nature, thou art a traitor to my soul.<br />
Thou hast abused my trust. I will complain<br />
To a superior court to right my wrong.<br />
I'll prove thee a forger of false assurances.<br />
In yon Star Chamber thou shalt answer it.<br />
Withdraw the bodies. O the sense of death<br />
Begins to trouble my distracted soul. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

Are you the gentlewoman in whose house<br />
The murders were committed?<br />
<br />
<i>Cata.</i> Yes, my lord.<br />
<br />

Your habit draws from ignorant respect<br />
Your name deserves not, nor yourself the name<br />

Infects the honour of all womanhood.<br />
<br />
<i>Cata.</i> My lord, I am a gentlewoman; yet<br />
I must confess my poverty compels<br />
My life to a condition lower than<br />
My birth or breeding.<br />
<br />
<i>2nd Judge.</i> Tush, we know your birth.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Judge.</i> But, under colour to profess the sale<br />
Of tires and toys for gentlewomen's pride,<br />
You draw a frequentation of men's wives<br />
To your licentious house, and there abuse<br />
Their husbands.&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Fres.</i> Good my lord, her rent is great.<br />
The good gentlewoman has no other thing<br />
To live by but her lodgings. So she's forced<br />
To let her fore-rooms out to others, and<br />
Herself contented to lie backwards.<br />
<br />
<i>2nd Judge.</i> So.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Judge.</i> Here is no evidence accuses you<br />
For accessories to the murder, yet<br />
Since from the spring of lust, which you preserved<br />
And nourished, ran the effusion of that blood,<br />
Your punishment shall come as near to death<br />
As life can bear it. Law cannot inflict<br />
Too much severity upon the cause<br />
Of such abhorred effects.<br />
<br />
<i>2nd Judge.</i> Receive your sentence.<br />
Your goods (since they were gotten by that means<br />
Which brings diseases) shall be turned to the use<br />
Of hospitals. You carted through the streets<br />
According to the common shame of strumpets,<br />
Your bodies whipped, till with the loss of blood<br />
You faint under the hand of punishment.<br />
Then that the necessary force of want<br />
May not provoke you to your former life,<br />
You shall be set to painful labour, whose<br />
Penurious gains shall only give you food<br />

Found in a place of such impiety!<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> I grant you. The place is full of impurity.
So much the more need of instruction and reformation.
The purpose that carried me thither was
with the spirit of conversion to purify their uncleanness,
and I hope your lordship will say the law
cannot take hold o' me for that.</p>

<p>
<i>1st Judge.</i> No, sir, it cannot; but yet give me leave<br />
To tell you that I hold your wary answer<br />
Rather premeditated for excuse<br />
Then spoken out of a religious purpose.<br />
Where took you your degrees of scholarship?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> I am no scholar, my lord. To speak the
sincere truth, I am Snuffe the tallow-chandler.</p>

<p>
<i>2nd Judge.</i> How comes your habits to be altered thus?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lang.</i> My Lord Belforest, taking a delight in the
cleanness of my conversation, withdrew me from that
unclean life and put me in a garment fit for his
society, and my present profession.</p>

<p>
<i>1st Judge.</i> His lordship did but paint a rotten post,<br />
Or cover foulness fairly. Monsieur Snuffe,<br />
Back to your candle-making! You may give<br />
The world more light with that, than either with<br />
Instruction or the example of your life.<br />

Thee, when thou wert apparelled in thy flesh,<br />

Outbidden like their limited performances.<br />

What comfort bring'st thou? how go things at court?<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> In silk and silver, brother: never braver.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Pooh!<br />
Thou play'st upon my meaning. Prythee, say,<br />
Has that bald madam, Opportunity,<br />
Yet thought upon's? speak, are we happy yet?<br />

But 'tis a marvel thou'rt not turned out yet!<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Faith, I've been shoved at; but 'twas still my hap<br />
To hold by the duchess' skirt: you guess at that:<br />
Whom such a coat keeps up, can ne'er fall flat.<br />
But to the purpose&mdash;<br />
Last evening, predecessor unto this,<br />
The duke's son warily inquired for me,<br />
Whose pleasure I attended: he began<br />
By policy to open and unhusk me<br />
About the time and common rumour:<br />
But I had so much wit to keep my thoughts<br />
Up in their built houses; yet afforded him<br />
An idle satisfaction without danger.<br />
But the whole aim and scope of his intent<br />
Ended in this: conjuring me in private<br />
To seek some strange-digested fellow forth,<br />
Of ill-contented nature; either disgraced<br />
In former times, or by new grooms displaced,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>Since his step-mother's nuptials; such a blood,<br />

Were there as many concubines as ladies,<br />
He would not be contained; he must fly out.<br />
I wonder how ill-featured, vile-proportioned,<br />
That one should be, if she were made for woman,<br />
Whom, at the insurrection of his lust,<br />
He would refuse for once. Heart! I think none.<br />
Next to a skull, though more unsound than one,<br />
Each face he meets he strongly doats upon.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Brother, y' have truly spoke him.<br />
He knows not you, but I will swear you know him.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> And therefore I'll put on that knave for once,<br />
And be a right man then, a man o' the time;<br />
For to be honest is not to be i' the world,<br />
Brother, I'll be that strange-composèd fellow.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> And I'll prefer you, brother.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Go to, then:<br />
The smallest advantage fattens wronged men:<br />
It may point but occasion; if I meet her,<br />

Women are apt, you know, to take false money;<br />

Youngest Son <i>brought out by</i> Officers. <i>Two</i>
Judges.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Duke.</i> Duchess, it is your youngest son, we're sorry<br />
His violent act has e'en drawn blood of honour,<br />
And stained our honours;<br />
Thrown ink upon the forehead of our state;<br />
Which envious spirits will dip their pens into<br />
After our death; and blot us in our tombs:<br />
For that which would seem treason in our lives<br />
Is laughter, when we're dead. Who dares now whisper,<br />
That dares not then speak out, and e'en proclaim<br />
With loud words and broad pens our closest shame?<br />
<br />
<i>1st Judge.</i> Your grace hath spoke like to your silver years,<br />
Full of confirmèd gravity; for what is it to have<br />
A flattering false insculption on a tomb,<br />
And in men's hearts reproach? the bowelled<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> corpse<br />
May be seared in, but (with free tongue I speak)<br />
The faults of great men through their sear-cloths break.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> They do; we're sorry for't: it is our fate<br />
To live in fear, and die to live in hate.<br />
I leave him to your sentence; doom him, lords&mdash;<br />
The fact is great&mdash;whilst I sit by and sigh.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> My gracious lord, I pray be merciful:<br />
Although his trespass far exceed his years,<br />
Think him to be your own, as I am yours;<br />
Call him not son-in-law: the law, I fear,<br />
Will fall too soon upon his name and him:<br />
Temper his fault with pity.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Good my lord,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>Then 'twill not taste so bitter and unpleasant<br />
Upon the judges' palate; for offences,<br />
Gilt o'er with mercy, show like fairest women,<br />
Good only for their beauties, which washed off,<br />
No sin is uglier.<br />
<br />
<i>Amb.</i> I beseech your grace,<br />
Be soft and mild; let not relentless law<br />
Look with an iron forehead on our brother.<br />
<br />
<i>Spu.</i> He yields small comfort yet; hope he shall die;<br />
And if a bastard's wish might stand in force,<br />
Would all the court were turned into a corse! [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> No pity yet? must I rise fruitless then?<br />
A wonder in a woman! are my knees<br />
Of such low metal, that without respect&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Judge.</i> Let the offender stand forth:<br />
'Tis the duke's pleasure that impartial doom<br />
Shall take fast hold of his unclean attempt.<br />
A rape! why 'tis the very core of lust&mdash;<br />
Double adultery.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> So, sir.<br />
<br />
<i>2nd Judge.</i> And which was worse,<br />
Committed on the Lord Antonio's wife,<br />
That general-honest lady. Confess, my lord,<br />
What moved you to't?<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> Why, flesh and blood, my lord;<br />
What should move men unto a woman else?<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> O, do not jest thy doom! trust not an axe<br />
Or sword too far: the law is a wise serpent,<br />
And quickly can beguile thee of thy life.<br />
Though marriage only has made thee my brother,<br />
I love thee so far: play not with thy death.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> I thank you, troth; good admonitions, faith,<br />
If I'd the grace now to make use of them.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Judge.</i> That lady's name has spread such a fair wing<br />
Over all Italy, that if our tongues<br />
Were sparing toward the fact, judgment itself<br />
Would be condemned, and suffer in men's thoughts.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span><br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> Well then, 'tis done; and it would please me well,<br />
Were it to do again: sure, she's a goddess,<br />
For I'd no power to see her, and to live.<br />
It falls out true in this, for I must die;<br />
Her beauty was ordained to be my scaffold.<br />
And yet, methinks, I might be easier 'sessed:<br />
My fault being sport, let me but die in jest.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Judge.</i> This be the sentence&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> O, keep't upon your tongue; let it not slip;<br />
Death too soon steals out of a lawyer's lip.<br />
Be not so cruel-wise!<br />
<br />
<i>1st Judge.</i> Your grace must pardon us;<br />
'Tis but the justice of the law.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> The law<br />
Is grown more subtle than a woman should be.<br />
<br />
<i>Spu.</i> Now, now he dies! rid 'em away. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> O, what it is to have an old cool duke,<br />
To be as slack in tongue as in performance! [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Duch.</i> O!<br />
<br />
<i>1st Judge.</i> To-morrow early&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Pray be abed, my lord.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Amb.</i> No, 'tis that tongue:<br />
Your too much right does do us too much wrong.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Live, and be in health.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Judge.</i> Be on a scaffold&mdash;<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Spu.</i> Pox on't,<br />
What makes my dad speak now? [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> We will defer the judgment till next sitting:<br />
In the meantime, let him be kept close prisoner.<br />
Guard, bear him hence.<br />
<br />

Fear not, we'll have a trick to set thee free. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span><br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> Brother, I will expect it from you both;<br />
And in that hope I rest. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Sup.</i> Farewell, be merry. [<i>Exit with a</i> Guard.<br />
<br />
<i>Spu.</i> Delayed! deferred! nay then, if judgment have cold blood,<br />
Flattery and bribes will kill it.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> About it, then, my lords, with your best powers:<br />
More serious business calls upon our hours.<br />
[<i>Exeunt, excepting the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Duch.</i> Was't ever known step-duchess was so mild<br />
And calm as I? some now would plot his death<br />
With easy doctors, those loose-living men,<br />
And make his withered grace fall to his grave,<br />
And keep church better.<br />
Some second wife would do this, and despatch<br />
Her double-loathèd lord at meat or sleep.<br />
Indeed, 'tis true, an old man's twice a child;<br />
Mine cannot speak; one of his single words<br />
Would quite have freed my youngest dearest son<br />
From death or durance, and have made him walk<br />
With a bold foot upon the thorny law,<br />
Whose prickles should bow under him; but 'tis not,<br />
And therefore wedlock-faith shall be forgot:<br />
I'll kill him in his forehead; hate, there feed;<br />
That wound is deepest, though it never bleed.<br />
And here comes he whom my heart points unto,<br />
His bastard son, but my love's true-begot;<br />
Many a wealthy letter have I sent him,<br />
Swelled up with jewels, and the timorous man<br />
Is yet but coldly kind.<br />
That jewel's mine that quivers in his ear,<br />
Mocking his master's chillness and vain fear.<br />
He has spied me now!<br />

O' the stable begot me; you know I know not!<br />
He could ride a horse well, a shrewd suspicion, marry!&mdash;<br />
He was wondrous tall: he had his length, i' faith.<br />
For peeping over half-shut holyday windows,<br />

He made a goodly show under a pent-house;<br />

Thou had'st been next set in the dukedom's ring,<br />

<br />

<br />

E'en in the worst way? I would thank that sin,<br />
That could most injure him, and be in league with it.<br />
O, what a grief 'tis that a man should live<br />
But once i' the world, and then to live a bastard&mdash;<br />
The curse o' the womb, the thief of nature,<br />
Begot against the seventh commandment,<br />
Half-damned in the conception by the justice<br />
Of that unbribèd everlasting law.<br />

Who but an eunuch would not sin? his bed,<br />

Step-mother, I consent to thy desires;<br />
I love thy mischief well; but I hate thee<br />
And those three cubs thy sons, wishing confusion,<br />
Death and disgrace may be their epitaphs.<br />
As for my brother, the duke's only son,<br />
Whose birth is more beholding to report<br />
Than mine, and yet perhaps as falsely sown<br />
(Women must not be trusted with their own),<br />
I'll loose my days upon him, hate-all-I;<br />
Duke, on thy brow I'll draw my bastardy:<br />
For indeed a bastard by nature should make cuckolds,<br />
Because he is the son of a cuckold-maker. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

pish, be bold with us&mdash;thy hand.</p>

<p>
<i>Ven.</i> With all my heart, i' faith: how dost, sweet musk-cat?<br />
When shall we lie together?<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Wondrous knave,<br />
Gather him into boldness! 'sfoot, the slave's<br />
Already as familiar as an ague,<br />
And shakes me at his pleasure. Friend, I can<br />
Forget myself in private; but elsewhere<br />
I pray do you remember me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O, very well, sir&mdash;I conster myself saucy.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> What hast been?<br />
Of what profession?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> A bone-setter.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> A bone-setter!<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> A bawd, my lord&mdash;<br />
One that sets bones together.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Notable bluntness!<br />
Fit, fit for me; e'en trained up to my hand:<br />
Thou hast been scrivener to much knavery, then?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> 'Sfoot, to abundance, sir: I have been witness<br />
To the surrenders of a thousand virgins:<br />
And not so little;<br />
I have seen patrimonies washed a-pieces,<br />
Fruit-fields turned into bastards,<br />
And in a world of acres<br />
Not so much dust due to the heir 'twas left to<br />
As would well gravel<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> a petition.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Fine villain! troth, I like him wondrously:<br />
He's e'en shaped for my purpose. [<i>Aside.</i>] Then thou know'st<br />
I' th' world strange lust?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O Dutch lust! fulsome lust!<br />
Drunken procreation! which begets so many drunkards<br />
Some fathers dread not (gone to bed in wine) to slide from the mother,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>And cling<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> the daughter-in-law;<br />
Some uncles are adulterous with their nieces:<br />
Brothers with brothers' wives. O hour of incest!<br />
Any kin now, next to the rim o' th' sister,<br />
Is men's meat in these days; and in the morning,<br />
When they are up and dressed, and their mask on,<br />
Who can perceive this, save that eternal eye,<br />
That sees through flesh and all? Well, if anything be damned,<br />
It will be twelve o'clock at night; that twelve<br />
Will never 'scape;<br />
It is the Judas of the hours, wherein<br />
Honest salvation is betrayed to sin.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> In troth, it is true; but let this talk glide.<br />
It is our blood to err, though hell gape wide.<br />
Ladies know Lucifer fell, yet still are proud.<br />
Now, sir, wert thou as secret as thou'rt subtle,<br />
And deeply fathomed into all estates,<br />
I would embrace thee for a near employment;<br />
And thou shouldst swell in money, and be able<br />
To make lame beggars crouch to thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> My lord,<br />
Secret! I ne'er had that disease o' the mother,<br />
I praise my father: why are men made close,<br />
But to keep thoughts in best? I grant you this,<br />
Tell but some women a secret over night,<br />
Your doctor may find it in the urinal i' the morning.<br />
But, my lord&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> So thou'rt confirmed in me,<br />
And thus I enter thee. [<i>Gives him money.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> This Indian devil<br />
Will quickly enter any man but a usurer;<br />
He prevents that by entering the devil first.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Attend me. I am past my depth in lust,<br />
And I must swim or drown. All my desires<br />
Are levelled at a virgin not far from court,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>To whom I have conveyed by messenger<br />
Many waxed lines, full of my neatest spirit,<br />
And jewels that were able to ravish her<br />
Without the help of man; all which and more<br />
She (foolish chaste) sent back, the messengers<br />
Receiving frowns for answers.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Possible!<br />
'Tis a rare Ph&#339;nix, whoe'er she be.<br />
If your desires be such, she so repugnant,<br />
In troth, my lord, I'd be revenged and marry her.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Pish! the dowry of her blood and of her fortunes<br />
Are both too mean&mdash;good enough to be bad withal.<br />
I'm one of that number can defend<br />
Marriage is good; yet rather keep a friend.<br />
Give me my bed by stealth&mdash;there's true delight;<br />
What breeds a loathing in't, but night by night!<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> A very fine religion!<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Therefore thus<br />
I'll trust thee in the business of my heart;<br />
Because I see thee well-experienced<br />
In this luxurious day wherein we breathe.<br />
Go thou, and with a smooth enchanting tongue<br />
Bewitch her ears, and cosen her of all grace:<br />
Enter upon the portion<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> of her soul&mdash;<br />
Her honour, which she calls her chastity,<br />
And bring it into expense; for honesty<br />
Is like a stock of money laid to sleep<br />
Which, ne'er so little broke, does never keep.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> You have gi'en't the tang,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> i' faith, my lord:<br />
Make known the lady to me, and my brain<br />
Shall swell with strange invention: I will move it,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>Till I expire with speaking, and drop down<br />
Without a word to save me&mdash;but I'll work&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> We thank thee, and will raise thee.&mdash;<br />
Receive her name; it is the only daughter to Madam<br />
Gratiana, the late widow.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O my sister, my sister! [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Why dost walk aside?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> My lord, I was thinking how I might begin:<br />
As thus, O lady&mdash;or twenty hundred devices&mdash;<br />
Her very bodkin will put a man in.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Ay, or the wagging of her hair.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> No, that shall put you in, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Shall't? why, content. Dost know the daughter then?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O, excellent well by sight.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> That was her brother,<br />
That did prefer thee to us.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> My lord, I think so;<br />
I knew I had seen him somewhere&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> And therefore, prythee, let thy heart to him<br />
Be as a virgin close.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O my good lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> We may laugh at that simple age within him.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Ha, ha, ha!<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Himself being made the subtle instrument,<br />
To wind up a good fellow.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a><br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> That's I, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> That's thou,<br />
To entice and work his sister.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> A pure novice!<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> 'Twas finely managed.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Gallantly carried!<br />
A pretty perfumed villain!<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> I've bethought me,<br />
If she prove chaste still and immovable,<br />
Venture upon the mother; and with gifts,<br />
As I will furnish thee, begin with her.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> O, fie, fie! that's the wrong end my lord.
'Tis mere impossible that a mother, by any gifts,
should become a bawd to her own daughter!</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> Nay, then, I see thou'rt but a puisne<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a><br />
In the subtle mystery of a woman.<br />
Why, 'tis held now no dainty dish: the name<br />
Is so in league with the age, that nowadays<br />
It does eclipse three quarters of a mother.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Does it so, my lord?<br />
Let me alone, then, to eclipse the fourth.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Why, well-said&mdash;come, I'll furnish thee, but first<br />
Swear to be true in all.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> True!</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Nay, but swear.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Swear?&mdash;I hope your honour little doubts
my faith.</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Yet, for my humour's sake, 'cause I love
swearing&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> 'Cause you love swearing,&mdash;'slud,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> I will.</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> Why, enough!<br />
Ere long look to be made of better stuff.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> That will do well indeed, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Attend me. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O!<br />
Now let me burst. I've eaten noble poison;<br />
We are made strange fellows, brother, innocent villains!<br />
Wilt not be angry, when thou hear'st on't, think'st thou?<br />
I' faith, thou shalt: swear me to foul my sister!<br />
Sword, I durst make a promise of him to thee;<br />
Thou shalt disheir him; it shall be thine honour.<br />
And yet, now angry froth is down in me,<br />
It would not prove the meanest policy,<br />
In this disguise, to try the faith of both.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>Another might have had the selfsame office;<br />
Some slave that would have wrought effectually,<br />
Ay, and perhaps o'erwrought 'em; therefore I,<br />
Being thought travelled, will apply myself<br />
Unto the selfsame form, forget my nature,<br />
As if no part about me were kin to 'em,<br />
So touch 'em;&mdash;though I durst almost for good<br />
Venture my lands in Heaven upon their blood. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio</span>, <i>whose</i> Wife <i>the</i> Duchess' Youngest
Son <i>ravished, discovering her dead body to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolito,
Piero</span>, <i>and</i> Lords.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Ant.</i> Draw nearer, lords, and be sad witnesses<br />
Of a fair comely building newly fallen,<br />
Being falsely undermined. Violent rape<br />
Has played a glorious act: behold, my lords,<br />
A sight that strikes man out of me.<br />
<br />
<i>Piero.</i> That virtuous lady!<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Precedent for wives!<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> The blush of many women, whose chaste presence<br />
Would e'en call shame up to their cheeks, and make<br />
Pale wanton sinners have good colours&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Dead!<br />
Her honour first drank poison, and her life,<br />
Being fellows in one house, did pledge her honour.<br />
<br />
<i>Piero.</i> O, grief of many!<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> I marked not this before&mdash;<br />
A prayer-book, the pillow to her cheek:<br />
This was her rich confection; and another<br />
Placed in her right hand, with a leaf tucked up,<br />
Pointing to these words;&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span><i>Melius virtute mori, quam per dedecus vivere:</i><br />
True and effectual it is indeed.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> My lord, since you invite us to your sorrows,<br />
Let's truly taste 'em, that with equal comfort,<br />
As to ourselves, we may relieve your wrongs:<br />
We have grief too, that yet walks without tongue;<br />
<i>Curæ leves loquuntur, majores stupent.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> You deal with truth, my lord;<br />
Lend me but your attentions, and I'll cut<br />
Long grief into short words. Last revelling night,<br />
When torch-light made an artificial noon<br />
About the court, some courtiers in the masque,<br />
Putting on better faces than their own,<br />
Being full of fraud and flattery&mdash;amongst whom<br />
The duchess' youngest son (that moth to honour)<br />
Filled up a room, and with long lust to eat<br />
Into my warren, amongst all the ladies<br />
Singled out that dear form, who ever lived<br />
As cold in lust as she is now in death<br />
(Which that step-duchess' monster knew too well),<br />
And therefore in the height of all the revels,<br />
When music was heard loudest, courtiers busiest,<br />
And ladies great with laughter&mdash;O vicious minute!<br />
Unfit but for relation to be spoke of:<br />
Then with a face more impudent than his vizard,<br />
He harried her amidst a throng of panders,<br />
That live upon damnation of both kinds,<br />
And fed the ravenous vulture of his lust.<br />
O death to think on't! She, her honour forced,<br />
Deemed it a nobler dowry for her name<br />
To die with poison than to live with shame.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> A wondrous lady! of rare fire compact;<br />
She has made her name an empress by that act.<br />
<br />
<i>Piero.</i> My lord, what judgment follows the offender?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Faith, none, my lord; it cools, and is deferred.<br />
<br />
<i>Piero.</i> Delay the doom for rape!<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> O, you must note who 'tis should die,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>The duchess' son! she'll look to be a saver:<br />
"Judgment, in this age, is near kin to favour."<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Nay, then, step forth, thou bribeless officer:<br />
[<i>Draws his sword.</i><br />
I'll bind you all in steel, to bind you surely;<br />
Here let your oaths meet, to be kept and paid,<br />
Which else will stick like rust, and shame the blade;<br />
Strengthen my vow that if, at the next sitting,<br />
Judgment speak all in gold, and spare the blood<br />
Of such a serpent, e'en before their seats<br />
To let his soul out, which long since was found<br />
Guilty in Heaven&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>All.</i> We swear it, and will act it.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Kind gentlemen, I thank you in mine ire.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> 'Twere pity<br />
The ruins of so fair a monument<br />
Should not be dipped in the defacer's blood.<br />
<br />
<i>Piero.</i> Her funeral shall be wealthy; for her name<br />
Merits a tomb of pearl. My Lord Antonio,<br />
For this time wipe your lady from your eyes;<br />
No doubt our grief and yours may one day court it,<br />
When we are more familiar with revenge.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> That is my comfort, gentlemen, and I joy<br />
In this one happiness above the rest,<br />
Which will be called a miracle at last;<br />
That, being an old man, I'd a wife so chaste.<br />

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Castiza</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Cas.</i> How hardly shall that maiden be beset,<br />
Whose only fortunes are her constant thoughts!<br />
That has no other child's part but her honour,<br />
That keeps her low and empty in estate;<br />
Maids and their honours are like poor beginners;<br />
Were not sin rich, there would be fewer sinners;<br />
Why had not virtue a revenue? Well,<br />
I know the cause, 'twould have impoverished hell.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dondolo</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>How now, Dondolo?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Madonna, there is one as they say, a thing
of flesh and blood&mdash;a man, I take him by his beard,
that would very desirously mouth to mouth with you.</p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> What's that?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Show his teeth in your company.</p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> I understand thee not.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Why, speak with you, madonna.</p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> Why, say so, madman, and cut off a great
deal of dirty way; had it not been better spoke in
ordinary words, that one would speak with me?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Ha, ha! that's as ordinary as two shillings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
I would strive a little to show myself in my place;
a gentleman-usher scorns to use the phrase and
fancy of a serving-man.</p>

<p>
<i>Cas.</i> Yours be your own, sir; go, direct him hither;<br />
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Dondolo</span>.<br />

Whence this?<br />

<br />
<i>Cas.</i> From whom?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> The duke's son!<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> Receive that. [<i>Boxes his ear.</i><br />
I swore I would put anger in my hand,<br />
And pass the virgin limits of my sex,<br />
To him that next appeared in that base office,<br />
To be his sin's attorney. Bear to him<br />
That figure of my hate upon thy cheek,<br />
Whilst 'tis yet hot, and I'll reward thee for't;<br />
Tell him my honour shall have a rich name,<br />
When several harlots shall share his with shame.<br />
Farewell; commend me to him in my hate. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

The finest drawn-work cuff that e'er was worn;<br />
I'll love this blow for ever, and this cheek<br />
Shall still henceforward take the wall of this.<br />
O, I'm above my tongue: most constant sister,<br />
In this thou hast right honourable shown;<br />

It is not in the power of words to taint thee.<br />
And yet for the salvation of my oath,<br />

A syren's tongue could not bewitch her so.<br />

Madam, good afternoon.<br />

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gratiana</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Gra.</i> Y'are welcome, sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> The next<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> of Italy commends him to you,<br />
Our mighty expectation, the duke's son.<br />
<br />

To rank me in his thoughts.<br />
<br />

One that is like to be our sudden duke;<br />
The crown gapes for him every tide, and then<br />
Commander o'er us all; do but think on him,<br />
How blessed were they, now that could pleasure him&mdash;<br />
E'en with anything almost!<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Ay, save their honour.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Tut, one would let a little of that go too,<br />
And ne'er be seen in't&mdash;ne'er be seen in't, mark you:<br />
I'd wink, and let it go.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Marry, but I would not.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Marry but I would, I hope; I know you would too,<br />
If you'd that blood now, which you gave your daughter.<br />
To her indeed 'tis this wheel<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> comes about;<br />
That man that must be all this, perhaps ere morning<br />
(For his white father does but mould away),<br />
Has long desired your daughter.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Desired?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Nay, but hear me;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>He desires now, that will command hereafter:<br />
Therefore be wise. I speak as more a friend<br />
To you than him: madam, I know you're poor,<br />
And, 'lack the day!<br />
There are too many poor ladies already;<br />
Why should you wax the number? 'Tis despised.<br />
Live wealthy, rightly understand the world,<br />
And chide away that foolish country girl<br />
Keeps company with your daughter&mdash;Chastity.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> O fie, fie! the riches of the world cannot hire<br />
A mother to such a most unnatural task.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> No, but a thousand angels<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> can.<br />
Men have no power, angels must work you to't:<br />
The world descends into such baseborn evils,<br />
That forty angels can make fourscore devils.<br />
There will be fools still, I perceive&mdash;still fools.<br />
Would I be poor, dejected, scorned of greatness,<br />
Swept from the palace, and see others' daughters<br />
Spring with the dew o' the court, having mine own<br />
So much desired and loved by the duke's son?<br />
No, I would raise my state upon her breast;<br />
And call her eyes my tenants; I would count<br />
My yearly maintenance upon her cheeks;<br />
Take coach upon her lip; and all her parts<br />
Should keep men after men, and I would ride<br />
In pleasure upon pleasure.<br />
You took great pains for her, once when it was;<br />
Let her requite it now, though it be but some.<br />
You brought her forth: she may well bring you home.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Not, I hope, already? [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> It is too strong for me; men know that know us,<br />
We are so weak their words can overthrow us;<br />

When his tongue struck upon my poor estate. [<i>Aside.</i><br />

I fear me she's unmothered; yet I'll venture.<br />
"That woman is all male, whom none can enter."<br />
[<i>Aside.</i><br />
What think you now, lady? Speak, are you wiser?<br />
What said advancement to you? Thus it said:<br />
The daughter's fall lifts up the mother's head.<br />
Did it not, madam? But I'll swear it does<br />
In many places: tut, this age fears no man.<br />
"'Tis no shame to be bad, because 'tis common."<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Ay, that's the comfort on't.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> The comfort on't!<br />
I keep the best for last&mdash;can these persuade you<br />
To forget Heaven&mdash;and&mdash;[<i>Gives her money.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Ay, these are they&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O!<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> That enchant our sex. These are<br />
The means that govern our affections&mdash;that woman<br />
Will not be troubled with the mother long,<br />
That sees the comfortable shine of you:<br />

Meet her: troops of celestial soldiers guard her heart.<br />
Yon dam has devils enough to take her part.<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> Madam, what makes yon evil-officed man<br />
In presence of you?<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Why?<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> He lately brought<br />
Immodest writing sent from the duke's son,<br />
To tempt me to dishonourable act.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Dishonourable act!&mdash;good honourable fool,<br />
That wouldst be honest, 'cause thou wouldst be so,<br />
Producing no one reason but thy will.<br />
And't has a good report, prettily commended,<br />
But pray, by whom? Poor people, ignorant people;<br />
The better sort, I'm sure, cannot abide it.<br />
And by what rule should we square out our lives,<br />
But by our betters' actions? O, if thou knew'st<br />
What 'twere to lose it, thou would never keep it!<br />
But there's a cold curse laid upon all maids,<br />
Whilst others clip<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> the sun, they clasp the shades.<br />
Virginity is paradise locked up.<br />
You cannot come by yourselves without fee;<br />
And 'twas decreed that man should keep the key!<br />
Deny advancement! treasure! the duke's son!<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> I cry you mercy! lady, I mistook you!<br />
Pray did you see my mother? which way went you?<br />
Pray God, I have not lost her.<br />
<br />

<br />

For that presumption now; but I'll forget it.<br />
Come, you shall leave those childish 'haviours,<br />
And understand your time. Fortunes flow to you;<br />
What, will you be a girl?<br />
If all feared drowning that spy waves ashore,<br />
Gold would grow rich, and all the merchants poor.<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> It is a pretty saying of a wicked one;<br />
But methinks now it does not show so well<br />
Out of your mouth&mdash;better in his!<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Faith, bad enough in both,<br />
Were I in earnest, as I'll seem no less. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
I wonder, lady, your own mother's words<br />
Cannot be taken, nor stand in full force.<br />
'Tis honesty you urge; what's honesty?<br />
'Tis but Heaven's beggar; and what woman is<br />
So foolish to keep honesty,<br />
And be not able to keep herself? No,<br />
Times are grown wiser, and will keep less charge.<br />
A maid that has small portion now intends<br />
To break up house, and live upon her friends;<br />
How blessed are you! you have happiness alone;<br />
Others must fall to thousands, you to one,<br />
Sufficient in himself to make your forehead<br />
Dazzle the world with jewels, and petitionary people<br />

To deal with my lord's grace?<br />
He'll add more honour to it by his title;<br />
Your mother will tell you how.<br />

All thrives but chastity; she lies a-cold.<br />
Nay, shall I come nearer to you? mark but this:<br />
Why are there so few honest women, but because
'tis the poorer profession? that's accounted best
that's best followed; least in trade, least in fashion;
and that's not honesty, believe it; and do but note
the love and dejected price of it&mdash;<br />

My lord shall be most welcome, when his pleasure<br />
Conducts him this way. I will sway mine own.<br />

O, more uncivil, more unnatural,<br />
Than those base-titled creatures that look downward;<br />
Why does not Heaven turn black, or with a frown<br />
Undo the world? Why does not earth start up,<br />
And strike the sins that tread upon't? O,<br />
Were't not for gold and women, there would be no damnation.<br />
Hell would look like a lord's great kitchen without fire in't.<br />
But 'twas decreed, before the world began,<br />
That they should be the hooks to catch at man.<br />

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> I much applaud<br />
Thy judgment; thou art well-read in a fellow;<br />
And 'tis the deepest art to study man.<br />
I know this, which I never learnt in schools,<br />
The world's divided into knaves and fools.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Knave in your face, my lord&mdash;behind your back&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> And I much thank thee, that thou hast preferred<br />
A fellow of discourse, well-mingled,<br />
And whose brain time hath seasoned.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> True, my lord,<br />
We shall find season once, I hope. O villain!<br />
To make such an unnatural slave of me&mdash;but&mdash;<br />
[<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />

[<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Your absence, leave us.<br />
<br />

I must remove; but, brother, you may stay.<br />
Heart! we are both made bawds a new-found way!<br />

<p>

Especially her brother;&mdash;say; be free,<br />
Have I a pleasure toward&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O my lord!<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Ravish me in thine answer; art thou rare?<br />
Hast thou beguiled her of salvation,<br />
And rubbed hell o'er with honey? Is she a woman?<br />
<br />

<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span><br />
<i>Ven.</i> The words I brought<br />
Might well have made indifferent honest naught.<br />
A right good woman in these days is changed<br />
Into white money with less labour far;<br />
Many a maid has turned to Mahomet<br />
With easier working: I durst undertake,<br />
Upon the pawn and forfeit of my life,<br />
With half those words to flat a Puritan's wife.<br />
But she is close and good; yet 'tis a doubt<br />
By this time.&mdash;O, the mother, the mother!<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> I never thought their sex had been a wonder,<br />
Until this minute. What fruit from the mother?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> How must I blister my soul, be forsworn,<br />
Or shame the woman that received me first!<br />
I will be true: thou liv'st not to proclaim.<br />
Spoke to a dying man, shame has no shame. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
My lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Who's that?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Here's none but I, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> What would thy haste utter?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Comfort.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Welcome.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> The maid being dull, having no mind to travel<br />
Into unknown lands, what did I straight,<br />
But set spurs to the mother? golden spurs<br />
Will put her to a false gallop in a trice.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Is't possible that in this<br />
The mother should be damned before the daughter?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> O, that's good manners, my lord; the mother
for her age must go foremost, you know.</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Thou'st spoke that true! but where comes
in this comfort?</p>

<p>
<i>Ven.</i> In a fine place, my lord,&mdash;the unnatural mother<br />
Did with her tongue so hard beset her honour,<br />
That the poor fool was struck to silent wonder;<br />
Yet still the maid, like an unlighted taper,<br />
Was cold and chaste, save that her mother's breath<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>Did blow fire on her cheeks. The girl departed;<br />
But the good ancient madam, half mad, threw me<br />
These promising words, which I took deeply note of:<br />
"My lord shall be most welcome"&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Faith, I thank her.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> "When his pleasure conducts him this way"&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> That shall be soon, i' faith.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> "I will sway mine own"&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> She does the wiser: I commend her for't.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> "Women with women can work best alone."<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> By this light, and so they can; give 'em their
due, men are not comparable to 'em.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> No, that's true; for you shall have one
woman knit more in an hour, than any man can ravel
again in seven-and-twenty years.</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> Now my desires are happy; I'll make 'em freemen now.<br />
Thou art a precious fellow; faith, I love thee;<br />
Be wise and make it thy revenue; beg, beg;<br />
What office couldst thou be ambitious for?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Office, my lord! marry, if I might have my
wish, I would have one that was never begged yet.</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Nay, then, thou canst have none.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Yes, my lord, I could pick out another office
yet; nay, and keep a horse and drab upon't.</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Prythee, good bluntness, tell me.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Why, I would desire but this, my lord&mdash;to
have all the fees behind the arras, and all the
farthingales that fall plump about twelve o'clock at
night upon the rushes.</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Thou'rt a mad, apprehensive knave; dost
think to make any great purchase of that?</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> O, 'tis an unknown thing, my lord; I wonder't
has been missed so long.</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> Well, this night I'll visit her, and 'tis till then<br />
A year in my desires&mdash;farewell, attend:<br />
Trust me with thy preferment.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span><br />
<i>Ven.</i> My loved lord! [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Lussurioso</span>.<br />
O, shall I kill him o' th' wrong side now? no!<br />
Sword, thou wast never a backbiter yet.<br />
I'll pierce him to his face; he shall die looking upon me.<br />
Thy veins are swelled with lust, this shall unfill 'em.<br />
Great men were gods, if beggars could not kill 'em.<br />
Forgive me, Heaven, to call my mother wicked!<br />
O, lessen not my days upon the earth,<br />
I cannot honour her. By this, I fear me,<br />
Her tongue has turned my sister unto use.<br />
I was a villain not to be forsworn<br />
To this our lecherous hope, the duke's son;<br />
For lawyers, merchants, some divines, and all,<br />
Count beneficial perjury a sin small.<br />
It shall go hard yet, but I'll guard her honour,<br />
And keep the ports sure. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

The mother has corrupted for his use.<br />

Night! thou that look'st like funeral heralds' fees,<br />
Torn down betimes i' the morning, thou hang'st fitly<br />

'Slud, it begins like a whore with good cheer.<br />
"Thou shalt not be long a prisoner."<br />
Not six-and-thirty years, like a bankrupt&mdash;I think so.<br />
"We have thought upon a device to get thee out by a trick."<br />
By a trick! pox o' your trick, an' it be so long a playing.<br />
"And so rest comforted,&mdash;be merry, and expect it suddenly!"<br />
Be merry! hang merry, draw and quarter merry;
I'll be mad. Is't not strange that a man should lie-in
a whole month for a woman? Well, we shall see
how sudden our brothers will be in their promise.
I must expect still a trick: I shall not be long a
prisoner. How now, what news?</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Officers.</p></blockquote>

<p>

Our office must be sound: here is our warrant,<br />
The signet from the duke; you must straight suffer.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> Suffer! I'll suffer you to begone; I'll suffer you<br />
To come no more; what would you have me suffer?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span><br />

The time's but brief with you: prepare to die.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> Sure, 'tis not so!<br />
<br />
<i>3rd Off.</i> It is too true, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> I tell you 'tis not; for the duke my father<br />
Deferred me till next sitting; and I look,<br />
E'en every minute, threescore times an hour,<br />
For a release, a trick wrought by my brothers.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Off.</i> A trick, my lord! if you expect such comfort,<br />
Your hope's as fruitless as a barren woman:<br />
Your brothers were the unhappy messengers<br />
That brought this powerful token for your death.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> My brothers? no, no.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> My brothers to bring a warrant for my death!<br />
How strange this shows!<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> Desire 'em hither: call 'em up&mdash;my brothers!<br />
They shall deny it to your faces.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Off.</i> My lord,<br />
They're far enough by this; at least at court;<br />
And this most strict command they left behind 'em.<br />
When grief swam in their eyes, they showed like brothers,<br />
Brimful of heavy sorrow&mdash;but the duke<br />
"Must have his pleasure."<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> His pleasure!<br />
<br />
<i>1st Off.</i> These were the last words, which my memory bears,<br />
"Commend us to the scaffold in our tears."<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> Pox dry their tears! what should I do with tears?<br />
I hate 'em worse than any citizen's son<br />
Can hate salt water. Here came a letter now,<br />
New-bleeding from their pens, scarce stinted yet:<br />
Would I'd been torn in pieces when I tore it:<br />

Look you then here, sir: "we'll get thee out by a trick," says he.<br />
</p>

<p><i>2nd Off.</i> That may hold too, sir; for you know a
trick is commonly four cards,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> which was meant by us
four officers.</p>

<p><i>Y. Son.</i> Worse and worse dealing.</p>

<p>
<i>1st. Off.</i> The hour beckons us.<br />
The headsman waits: lift up your eyes to Heaven.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> I thank you, faith; good pretty wholesome counsel!<br />
I should look up to Heaven, as you said,<br />
Whilst he behind me cosens me of my head.<br />
Ay, that's the trick.<br />
<br />
<i>3rd Off.</i> You delay too long, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> Stay, good authority's bastards; since I must<br />
Through brothers' perjury, die, O, let me venom<br />
Their souls with curses.<br />
<br />
<i>3rd Off.</i> Come, 'tis no time to curse.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Son.</i> Must I bleed then without respect of sign? well&mdash;<br />
My fault was sweet sport which the world approves,<br />
I die for that which every woman loves. [<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

Why may not I partake with you? you vowed once<br />
To give me share to every tragic thought.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> By the mass, I think I did too;<br />
Then I'll divide it to thee. The old duke,<br />
Thinking my outward shape and inward heart<br />
Are cut out of one piece (for he that prates his secrets,<br />
His heart stands o' the outside), hires me by price<br />
To greet him with a lady<br />
In some fit place, veiled from the eyes o' the court,<br />
Some darkened, blushless angle, that is guilty<br />
Of his forefather's lust and great folks' riots;<br />
To which I easily (to maintain my shape)<br />
Consented, and did wish his impudent grace<br />
To meet her here in this unsunnèd lodge,<br />
Wherein 'tis night at noon; and here the rather<br />
Because, unto the torturing of his soul,<br />
The bastard and the duchess have appointed<br />
Their meeting too in this luxurious circle;<br />
Which most afflicting sight will kill his eyes,<br />
Before we kill the rest of him.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> 'Twill, i' faith! Most dreadfully digested!<br />
I see not how you could have missed me, brother.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> True; but the violence of my joy forgot it.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Ay, but where's that lady now?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O! at that word<br />
I'm lost again; you cannot find me yet:<br />
I'm in a throng of happy apprehensions.<br />
He's suited for a lady; I have took care<br />
For a delicious lip, a sparkling eye&mdash;<br />
Yon shall be witness, brother:<br />
Be ready; stand with your hat off. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

Yet 'tis no wonder, now I think again,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>To have a lady stoop to a duke, that stoops unto his men.<br />

<br />

As such all hid, beguile a wiser man.<br />
Have I not fitted the old surfeiter<br />
With a quaint piece of beauty? Age and bare bone<br />
Are e'er allied in action. Here's an eye,<br />
Able to tempt a great man&mdash;to serve God:<br />
A pretty hanging lip, that has forgot now to dissemble.<br />
Methinks this mouth should make a swearer tremble;<br />
A drunkard clasp his teeth, and not undo 'em,<br />
To suffer wet damnation to run through 'em.<br />
Here's a cheek keeps her colour, let the wind go whistle:<br />
Spout, rain, we fear thee not: be hot or cold,<br />

For thee? For thee does she undo herself?<br />
Are lordships sold to maintain ladyships,<br />
For the poor benefit of a bewildering minute?<br />
Why does yon fellow falsify highways,<br />
And put his life between the judge's lips,<br />
To refine such a thing&mdash;keeps horse and men<br />
To beat their valours for her?<br />
Surely we are all mad people, and they<br />
Whom we think are, are not: we mistake those;<br />
'Tis we are mad in sense, they but in clothes.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Faith, and in clothes too we, give us our due.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Does every proud and self-affecting dame,<br />
Camphire her face for this, and grieve her Maker<br />
In sinful baths of milk, when many an infant starves<br />
For her superfluous outside&mdash;all for this?<br />
Who now bids twenty pounds a night? prepares<br />
Music, perfumes, and sweetmeats? All are hushed.<br />
Thou may'st lie chaste now! it were fine, methinks,<br />
To have thee seen at revels, forgetful feasts,<br />
And unclean brothels! sure, 'twould fright the sinner,<br />
And make him a good coward: put a reveller<br />
Out of his antic amble,<br />
And cloy an epicure with empty dishes.<br />
Here might a scornful and ambitious woman<br />
Look through and through herself. See, ladies, with false forms<br />
You deceive men, but cannot deceive worms.&mdash;<br />
Now to my tragic business. Look you, brother,<br />
I have not fashioned this only for show<br />
And useless property; no, it shall bear a part<br />
E'en in its own revenge. This very skull,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>Whose mistress the duke poisoned, with this drug,<br />
The mortal curse of the earth, shall be revenged<br />
In the like strain, and kiss his lips to death.<br />
As much as the dumb thing can, he shall feel:<br />
What fails in poison, we'll supply in steel.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Brother, I do applaud thy constant vengeance&mdash;<br />
The quaintness of thy malice&mdash;above thought.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> So, 'tis laid on:<br />
[<i>He poisons the lips of the skull</i>]<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">now come and welcome, duke,</span><br />
I have her for thee. I protest it, brother,<br />
Methinks she makes almost as fair a fine,<br />
As some old gentlewoman in a periwig.<br />
Hide thy face now for shame; thou hadst need have a mask now:<br />
'Tis vain when beauty flows; but when it fleets,<br />
This would become graves better than the streets.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> You have my voice in that: hark, the duke's come.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Peace, let's observe what company he brings,<br />
And how he does absent 'em; for you know<br />
He'll wish all private. Brother, fall you back a little<br />
With the bony lady.<br />
<br />

</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Faith, my lord, a country lady, a little bashful
at first, as most of them are; but after the first
kiss, my lord, the worst is past with them. Your
grace knows now what you have to do; she has
somewhat a grave look with her&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Royal villain! white devil!<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> O!<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Brother, place the torch here, that his affrighted eyeballs<br />
May start into those hollows. Duke, dost know<br />
Yon dreadful vizard? View it well; 'tis the skull<br />
Of Gloriana, whom thou poisonedst last.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> O! 't has poisoned me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Didst not know that till now?<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> What are you two?<br />
<br />

Has been sufficiently revenged.<br />
<br />

A slavish duke is baser than his slaves.<br />

[<i>Discovers himself.</i><br />
My once betrothèd wife.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> Is it thou, villain? nay, then&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> 'Tis I, 'tis Vendice, 'tis I.<br />
<br />

Fell sick upon the infection of thy frowns,<br />
And died in sadness: be that thy hope of life.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> O!<br />
<br />

Pooh! 'tis but early yet; now I'll begin<br />
To stick thy soul with ulcers. I will make<br />
Thy spirit grievous sore; it shall not rest,<br />
But like some pestilent man toss in thy breast. Mark me, duke:<br />

Their banquet is prepared, they're coming&mdash;<br />

<br />
<i>Ven.</i> What! is not thy tongue eaten out yet?<br />
Then we'll invent a silence. Brother, stifle the torch.<br />

<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Nay, faith, we'll have you hushed. Now with thy dagger<br />
Nail down his tongue, and mine shall keep possession<br />
About his heart; if he but gasp, he dies;<br />
We dread not death to quittance injuries.<br />
Brother, if he but wink, not brooking the foul object,<br />
Let our two other hands tear up his lids,<br />
And make his eyes like comets shine through blood.<br />
When the bad bleeds, then is the tragedy good.<br />

Did I not draw the model of his death;<br />
Advising you to sudden officers<br />

Give him his due.<br />

<br />

He bids me be present to depart; something<br />
Has stung his honour.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Be nearer; draw nearer:<br />
Ye're not so good, methinks; I'm angry with you.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> With me, my lord? I'm angry with myself for't.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> You did prefer a goodly fellow to me:<br />
'Twas wittily elected; 'twas. I thought<br />
He had been a villain, and he proves a knave&mdash;<br />
To me a knave.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> I chose him for the best, my lord:<br />
'Tis much my sorrow, if neglect in him<br />
Breed discontent in you.<br />

Incestuous sweets between 'em.<br />

<br />
<i>Lus.</i> I, in kind loyalty to my father's forehead,<br />
Made this a desperate arm; and in that fury<br />
Committed treason on the lawful bed,<br />
And with my sword e'en rased my father's bosom,<br />
For which I was within a stroke of death.<br />
<br />

<p>

Make thee a perpetual prisoner,<br />

<br />

<br />

I know not whether falsely, that you'd a brother.<br />

<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Faith, to curse fates<br />
Who, as he thinks, ordained him to be poor&mdash;<br />
Keeps at home, full of want and discontent.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> There's hope in him; for discontent and want<br />
Is the best clay to mould a villain of. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
Hippolito, wish him repair to us:<br />
If there be ought in him to please our blood,<br />
For thy sake we'll advance him, and build fair<br />
His meanest fortunes; for it is in us<br />
To rear up towers from cottages.<br />

But he's a man in whom much melancholy dwells.<br />

<br />

Whom he cast off e'en now, must now succeed.<br />
Brother, disguise must off;<br />
In thine own shape now I'll prefer thee to him:<br />
How strangely does himself work to undo him!<br />
[<i>Aside. Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> This fellow will come fitly; he shall kill<br />
That other slave, that did abuse my spleen,<br />
And made it swell to treason. I have put<br />
Much of my heart into him; he must die.<br />
He that knows great men's secrets, and proves slight,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a><br />
That man ne'er lives to see his beard turn white.<br />
Ay, he shall speed him: I'll employ the brother;<br />
Slaves are but nails to drive out one another.<br />
He being of black condition, suitable<br />
To want and ill-content, hope of preferment<br />
Will grind him to an edge.<br />

<p><i>2nd Noble.</i> There's none i' th' court had any
knowledge on't.</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> His grace is old and sudden: 'tis no treason<br />
To say the duke, my father, has a humour,<br />
Or such a toy about him; what in us<br />
Would appear light, in him seems virtuous.<br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vendice</span>, <i>out of his disguise, and</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolito</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hip.</i> So, so, all's as it should be, y'are yourself.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> How that great villain puts me to my shifts!</p>

<p>
<i>Hip.</i> He that did lately in disguise reject thee,<br />
Shall, now thou art thyself, as much respect thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> 'Twill be the quainter fallacy. But, brother,<br />
'Sfoot, what use will he put me to now, think'st thou?<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Nay, you must pardon me in that: I know not.<br />
He has some employment for you: but what 'tis,<br />
He and his secretary (the devil) know best.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Well, I must suit my tongue to his desires,<br />
What colour soe'er they be; hoping at last<br />
To pile up all my wishes on his breast.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Faith, brother, he himself shows the way.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span><br />
<i>Ven.</i> Now the duke is dead, the realm is clad in clay.<br />
His death being not yet known, under his name<br />
The people still are governed. Well, thou his son<br />
Art not long-lived: thou shalt not joy his death.<br />
To kill thee, then, I should most honour thee;<br />
For 'twould stand firm in every man's belief,<br />
Thou'st a kind child, and only died'st with grief.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> You fetch about well; but let's talk in present.<br />
How will you appear in fashion different,<br />
As well as in apparel, to make all things possible?<br />
If you be but once tripped, we fall for ever.<br />
It is not the least policy to be doubtful;<br />
You must change tongue: familiar was your first.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Why, I'll bear me in some strain of melancholy,<br />
And string myself with heavy-sounding wire,<br />
Like such an instrument, that speaks merry things sadly.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Then 'tis as I meant;<br />
I gave you out at first in discontent.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> I'll tune myself, and then&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> 'Sfoot, here he comes. Hast thought upon't?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Salute him; fear not me.<br />

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> Hippolito!<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Your lordship&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> What's he yonder?<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> 'Tis Vendice, my discontented brother,<br />
Whom, 'cording to your will, I've brought to court.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Is that thy brother? Beshrew me, a good presence;<br />
I wonder he has been from the court so long.<br />
Come nearer.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Brother! Lord Lussurioso, the duke's son.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Be more near to us; welcome; nearer yet.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> How don you? gi' you good den.<br />
[<i>Takes off his hat and bows.</i><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span><br />
<i>Lus.</i> We thank thee.<br />
How strangely such a coarse homely salute<br />
Shows in the palace, where we greet in fire,<br />
Nimble and desperate tongues! should we name<br />
God in a salutation, 'twould ne'er be stood on;&mdash;Heaven!<br />
Tell me, what has made thee so melancholy?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Why, going to law.</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Why, will that make a man melancholy?</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Yes, to look long upon ink and black buckram.
I went me to law in <i>anno quadragesimo secundo</i>,
and I waded out of it in <i>anno sexagesimo tertio</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> What, three-and-twenty years in law?</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> I have known those that have been five-and-fifty,
and all about pullen<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and pigs.</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> May it be possible such men should breathe,<br />
To vex the terms so much?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> 'Tis food to some, my lord. There are old
men at the present, that are so poisoned with the
affectation of law-words (having had many suits
canvassed), that their common talk is nothing but
Barbary Latin. They cannot so much as pray but
in law, that their sins may be removed with a writ
of error, and their souls fetched up to Heaven with
a sasarara.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> It seems most strange to me;<br />
Yet all the world meets round in the same bent:<br />
Where the heart's set, there goes the tongue's consent.<br />
How dost apply thy studies, fellow?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Study? why, to think how a great rich man
lies a-dying, and a poor cobbler tolls the bell for
him. How he cannot depart the world, and see the
great chest stand before him; when he lies speechless,
how he will point you readily to all the boxes;
and when he is past all memory, as the gossips
guess, then thinks he of forfeitures and obligations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
nay, when to all men's hearings he whurls and
rattles in the throat, he's busy threatening his poor
tenants. And this would last me now some seven
years' thinking, or thereabouts. But I have a
conceit a-coming in picture upon this; I draw it
myself, which, i' faith, la, I'll present to your honour;
you shall not choose but like it, for your honour
shall give me nothing for it.</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> Nay, you mistake me, then,<br />
For I am published bountiful enough.<br />
Let's taste of your conceit.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> In picture, my Lord?</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Ay, in picture.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Marry, this it is&mdash;"A usuring father to be
boiling in hell, and his son and heir with a whore
dancing over him."</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> He has pared him to the quick. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> The conceit's pretty, i' faith;<br />
But, take't upon my life, 'twill ne'er be liked.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> No? why I'm sure the whore will be liked
well enough.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Aye, if she were out o' the picture, he'd like
her then himself. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> And as for the son and heir, he shall be an
eyesore to no young revellers, for he shall be drawn
in cloth-of-gold breeches.</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> And thou hast put my meaning in the pockets,<br />
And canst not draw that out? My thought was this:<br />
To see the picture of a usuring father<br />
Boiling in hell&mdash;our rich men would never like it.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O, true, I cry you heartily mercy,<br />
I know the reason, for some of them had rather<br />
Be damned in deed than damned in colours.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> A parlous melancholy! he has wit enough<br />
To murder any man, and I'll give him means. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
I think thou art ill-moneyed?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Money! ho, ho!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>'T has been my want so long, 'tis now my scoff:<br />
I've e'en forgot what colour silver's of.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> It hits as I could wish. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> I get good clothes<br />
Of those that dread my humour; and for table-room<br />
I feed on those that cannot be rid of me.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Somewhat to set thee up withal.<br />
[<i>Gives him money.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O mine eyes!<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Almost struck blind;<br />
This bright unusual shine to me seems proud;<br />
I dare not look till the sun be in a cloud.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> I think I shall affect<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> his melancholy,<br />
How are they now?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> The better for your asking.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> You shall be better yet, if you but fasten<br />
Truly on my intent. Now y'are both present,<br />
I will unbrace such a close private villain<br />
Unto your vengeful swords, the like ne'er heard of,<br />
Who hath disgraced you much, and injured us.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Disgraced us, my lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Ay, Hippolito.<br />
I kept it here till now, that both your angers<br />
Might meet him at once.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> I'm covetous<br />
To know the villain.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> You know him: that slave-pander,<br />
Piato, whom we threatened last<br />
With irons in perpetual 'prisonment.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> All this is I. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Is't he, my lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> I'll tell you; you first preferred him to me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Did you, brother?<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> I did indeed.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> And the ungrateful villain,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>To quit that kindness, strongly wrought with me&mdash;<br />
Being, as you see, a likely man for pleasure&mdash;<br />
With jewels to corrupt your virgin sister.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> O villain!<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> He shall surely die that did it.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> I, far from thinking any virgin harm,<br />
Especially knowing her to be as chaste<br />
As that part which scarce suffers to be touched&mdash;<br />
The eye&mdash;would not endure him.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Would you not, my lord?<br />
'Twas wondrous honourably done.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> But with some fine frowns kept him out.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Out, slave!<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> What did me he, but in revenge of that,<br />
Went of his own free will to make infirm<br />
Your sister's honour (whom I honour with my soul<br />
For chaste respect) and not prevailing there<br />
(As 'twas but desperate folly to attempt it),<br />
In mere spleen, by the way, waylays your mother,<br />
Whose honour being a coward as it seems,<br />
Yielded by little force.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Coward indeed!<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> He, proud of this advantage (as he thought),<br />
Brought me this news for happy. But I, Heaven forgive me for't!&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> What did your honour?<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> In rage pushed him from me,<br />
Trampled beneath his throat, spurned him, and bruised:<br />
Indeed I was too cruel, to say troth.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Most nobly managed!<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Has not Heaven an ear? is all the lightning wasted?<br />
[<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> If I now were so impatient in a modest cause,<br />
What should you be?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Full mad: he shall not live<br />
To see the moon change.<br />
<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>Hippolito, entice him this way, that thy brother<br />
May take full mark of him.<br />
<br />

I can direct him so far.<br />

<i>Lus.</i> Yet for my hate's sake,<br />
Go, wind him this way. I'll see him bleed myself.<br />

And kill thine enemies.<br />

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolito</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>

<br />

<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Your good lordship<br />
Would have a loathsome sight of him, much offensive.<br />
He's not in case now to be seen, my lord.<br />
The worst of all the deadly sins is in him&mdash;<br />
That beggarly damnation, drunkenness.<br />
<br />

<br />

Firmly resolved? I'll see him dead myself.<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Your honour's vassals.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> This was wisely carried. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
Deep policy in us makes fools of such:<br />
Then must a slave die, when he knows too much.<br />
[<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O thou almighty patience! 'tis my wonder<br />
That such a fellow, impudent and wicked,<br />
Should not be cloven as he stood;<br />
Or with a secret wind burst open!<br />
Is there no thunder left: or is't kept up<br />
In stock for heavier vengeance? [<i>Thunder</i>] there it goes!<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Brother, we lose ourselves.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> But I have found it;<br />
'Twill hold, 'tis sure; thanks, thanks to any spirit,<br />
That mingled it 'mongst my inventions.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> What is't?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> 'Tis sound and good; thou shalt partake it;<br />
I'm hired to kill myself.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> True.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Prythee, mark it;<br />
And the old duke being dead, but not conveyed,<br />
For he's already missed too, and you know<br />
Murder will peep out of the closest husk&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Most true.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> What say you then to this device?<br />
If we dressed up the body of the duke?<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> In that disguise of yours?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Y'are quick, y' have reached it.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> I like it wondrously.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> And being in drink, as you have published him.<br />
To lean him on his elbow, as if sleep had caught him,<br />
Which claims most interest in such sluggy men?<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Good yet; but here's a doubt;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>We, thought by the duke's son to kill that pander,<br />
Shall, when he is known, be thought to kill the duke.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Neither, O thanks! it is substantial:<br />
For that disguise being on him which I wore,<br />
It will be thought I, which he calls the pander, did
kill the duke, and fled away in his apparel, leaving
him so disguised to avoid swift pursuit.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Firmer and firmer.</p>

<p>
<i>Ven.</i> Nay, doubt not, 'tis in grain: I warrant it holds colour.<br />
<br />

<i>Ven.</i> O common madness!<br />
Ask but the thrivingest harlot in cold blood,<br />
She'd give the world to make her honour good.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>Perhaps you'll say, but only to the duke's son<br />
In private; why she first begins with one,<br />
Who afterward to thousands prove a whore:<br />
"Break ice in one place, it will crack in more."<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Most certainly applied!<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> O brother, you forget our business.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> And well-remembered; joy's a subtle elf,<br />
I think man's happiest when he forgets himself.<br />
Farewell, once dry, now holy-watered mead;<br />
Our hearts wear feathers, that before wore lead.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> I'll give you this&mdash;that one I never knew<br />
Plead better for and 'gainst the devil than you.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> You make me proud on't.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Commend us in all virtue to our sister.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Ay, for the love of Heaven, to that true maid.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> With my best words.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Why, that was motherly said.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a><br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Vendice</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolito</span>.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> I wonder now, what fury did transport me!<br />
I feel good thoughts begin to settle in me.<br />
O, with what forehead can I look on her,<br />
Whose honour I've so impiously beset?<br />
And here she comes&mdash;<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Castiza</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Cas.</i> Now, mother, you have wrought with me so strongly<br />
That what for my advancement, as to calm<br />
The trouble of your tongue, I am content.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Content, to what?<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> To do as you have wished me;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>To prostitute my breast to the duke's son;<br />
And put myself to common usury.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> I hope you will not so!<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> Hope you I will not?<br />
That's not the hope you look to be saved in.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Truth, but it is.<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> Do not deceive yourself;<br />
I am as you, e'en out of marble wrought.<br />
What would you now? are ye not pleased yet with me?<br />
You shall not wish me to be more lascivious<br />
Than I intend to be.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Strike not me cold.<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> How often have you charged me on your blessing<br />
To be a cursèd woman? When you knew<br />
Your blessing had no force to make me lewd,<br />
You laid your curse upon me: that did more,<br />
The mother's curse is heavy; where that fights,<br />
Suns set in storm, and daughters lose their lights.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Good child, dear maid, if there be any spark<br />
Of heavenly intellectual fire within thee,<br />
O, let my breath revive it to a flame!<br />
Put not all out with woman's wilful follies.<br />
I am recovered of that foul disease,<br />
That haunts too many mothers; kind, forgive me,<br />
Make me not sick in health! If then<br />
My words prevailed, when they were wickedness,<br />
How much more now, when they are just and good?<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> I wonder what you mean! are not you she,<br />
For whose infect persuasions I could scarce<br />
Kneel out my prayers, and had much ado<br />
In three hours' reading to untwist so much<br />
Of the black serpent as you wound about me?<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> 'Tis unfruitful, child, and tedious to repeat<br />
What's past; I'm now your present mother.<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> Tush! now 'tis too late.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> Bethink again: thou know'st not what thou say'st.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span><br />
<i>Cas.</i> No! deny advancement? treasure? the duke's son?<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> O, see! I spoke those words, and now they poison me!<br />
What will the deed do then?<br />
Advancement? true; as high as shame can pitch!<br />
For treasure; who e'er knew a harlot rich?<br />
Or could build by the purchase of her sin<br />
An hospital to keep her bastards in?<br />
The duke's son! O, when women are young courtiers,<br />
They are sure to be old beggars;<br />
To know the miseries most harlots taste,<br />
Thou'dst wish thyself unborn, when thou art unchaste.<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> O mother, let me twine about your neck,<br />
And kiss you, till my soul melt on your lips!<br />
I did but this to try you.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra.</i> O, speak truth!<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> Indeed I did but; for no tongue has force<br />
To alter me from honest.<br />
If maidens would, men's words could have no power;<br />
A virgin's honour is a crystal tower<br />
Which (being weak) is guarded with good spirits;<br />
Until she basely yields, no ill inherits.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>, O happy child! faith, and thy birth hath saved me.<br />
'Mong thousand daughters, happiest of all others:<br />
Be thou a glass for maids, and I for mothers.<br />

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH.</h3>

<h4>SCENE I.<i>&mdash;A Room in the Lodge. The</i> <span class="smcap">Duke's</span>
<i>corpse, dressed in</i> <span class="smcap">Vendice's</span> <i>disguise, lying on
a couch.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vendice</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolito</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ven.</i> So, so, he leans well; take
heed you wake him not, brother.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I warrant you my life for
yours.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> That's a good lay, for I
must kill myself.<br />
Brother, that's I, that sits for me:
do you mark it? And I must stand ready here to
make away myself yonder. I must sit to be killed,
and stand to kill myself. I could vary it not so little
as thrice over again; 't has some eight returns, like
Michaelmas term.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> That's enow, o' conscience.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> But, sirrah, does the duke's son come single?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No; there's the hell on't: his faith's too
feeble to go alone. He brings flesh-flies after him,
that will buzz against supper-time, and hum for his
coming out.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Ah, the fly-flap of vengeance beat 'em to
pieces! Here was the sweetest occasion, the fittest
hour, to have made my revenge familiar with him;
show him the body of the duke his father, and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
quaintly he died, like a politician, in hugger-mugger,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
made no man acquainted with it; and in catastrophe
slay him over his father's breast. O, I'm mad to
lose such a sweet opportunity!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, tush! prythee, be content! there's no
remedy present; may not hereafter times open in as
fair faces as this?</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> They may, if they can paint so well.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Come now: to avoid all suspicion, let's forsake
this room, and be going to meet the duke's son.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Content: I'm for any weather. Heart! step
close: here he comes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lussurioso</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hip.</i> My honoured lord!</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> O me! you both present?</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> E'en newly, my lord, just as your lordship
entered now: about this place we had notice given
he should be, but in some loathsome plight or other.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Came your honour private?</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> Private enough for this; only a few<br />
Attend my coming out.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> Death rot those few! [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Stay, yonder's the slave.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Mass, there's the slave, indeed, my lord.<br />
'Tis a good child: he calls his father a slave! [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Ay, that's the villain, the damned villain.<br />
Softly. Tread easy.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Pah! I warrant you, my lord, we'll stifle in<br />
our breaths.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> That will do well:<br />
Base rogue, thou sleepest thy last; 'tis policy<br />
To have him killed in's sleep; for if he waked,<br />
He would betray all to them.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> But, my lord&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Ha, what say'st?<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Shall we kill him now he's drunk?</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Ay, best of all.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Why, then he will ne'er live to be sober.</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> No matter, let him reel to hell.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> But being so full of liquor, I fear he will put
out all the fire.</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Thou art a mad beast.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> And leave none to warm your lordship's golls<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
withal; for he that dies drunk falls into hell-fire
like a bucket of water&mdash;qush, qush!</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Come, be ready: nake<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> your swords: think
of your wrongs; this slave has injured you.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Troth, so he has, and he has paid well for't.</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Meet with him now.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> You'll bear us out, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Pooh! am I a lord for nothing, think you?
quickly now!</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Sa, sa, sa, thump [<i>Stabs the</i> <span class="smcap">Duke's</span> <i>corpse</i>]&mdash;there
he lies.</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> Nimbly done.&mdash;Ha! O villains! murderers!<br />
'Tis the old duke, my father.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> That's a jest.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> What stiff and cold already!<br />
O, pardon me to call you from your names:<br />
'Tis none of your deed. That villain Piato,<br />
Whom you thought now to kill, has murdered<br />
And left him thus disguised.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> And not unlikely.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O rascal! was he not ashamed<br />
To put the duke into a greasy doublet?<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> He has been stiff and cold&mdash;who knows how long?<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Marry, that I do. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> No words, I pray, of anything intended.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> O my lord.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I would fain have your lordship think that
we have small reason to prate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> Faith, thou say'st true; I'll forthwith send to court<br />
For all the nobles, bastard, duchess; tell,<br />
How here by miracle we found him dead,<br />
And in his raiment that foul villain fled.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> That will be the best way, my lord,<br />
To clear us all; let's cast about to be clear.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Ho! Nencio, Sordido, and the rest!<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter all of them.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>1st Ser.</i> My lord.</p>

<p><i>2nd Ser.</i> My lord.</p>

<p>
<i>Lus.</i> Be witnesses of a strange spectacle.<br />
Choosing for private conference that sad room,<br />
We found the duke my father gealed in blood.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Ser.</i> My lord the duke! run, hie thee, Nencio.<br />
Startle the court by signifying so much.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Thus much by wit a deep revenger can,<br />
When murder's known, to be the clearest man.<br />
We're farthest off, and with as bold an eye<br />
Survey his body as the standers-by. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> My royal father, too basely let blood<br />
By a malevolent slave!<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Ven.</i> He has lost: he may. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> O sight! look hither, see, his lips are gnawn<br />
With poison.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> How! his lips? by the mass, they be.<br />
O villain! O rogue! O slave! O rascal!<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> O good deceit! he quits him with like terms.<br />

In deadly fire?<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lus.</i> Behold, behold, my lords, the duke my
father's murdered by a vassal that owes this habit,
and here left disguised.</p>

<p><i>1st Noble.</i> Reverend majesty!</p>

<p>
<i>2nd Noble.</i> I have seen these clothes often attending on him.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> That nobleman has been' i' th' country, for he does not lie.<br />
[<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Sup.</i> Learn of our mother; let's dissemble too:<br />
I am glad he's vanished; so, I hope, are you.<br />
<br />
<i>Amb.</i> Ay, you may take my word for't.<br />
<br />
<i>Spu.</i> Old dad dead!<br />
I, one of his cast sins, will send the Fates<br />
Most hearty commendations by his own son;<br />
I'll tug in the new stream, till strength be done.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Where be those two that did affirm to us,<br />
My lord the duke was privately rid forth?<br />
<br />
<i>1st Gent.</i> O, pardon us, my lords; he gave that charge&mdash;<br />
Upon our lives, if he were missed at court,<br />
To answer so; he rode not anywhere;<br />
We left him private with that fellow here.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Confirmed. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> O Heavens! that false charge was his death.<br />
Impudent beggars! durst you to our face<br />
Maintain such a false answer? Bear him straight<br />
To execution.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Gent.</i> My lord!<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Urge me no more in this!<br />
The excuse may be called half the murder.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> You've sentenced well. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Away; see it be done.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Could you not stick? See what confession doth!<br />
Who would not lie, when men are hanged for truth?<br />
[<i>Aside.</i><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span><br />
<i>Hip.</i> Brother, how happy is our vengeance! [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Why, it hits past the apprehension of<br />
Indifferent wits. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> My lord, let post-horses be sent<br />
Into all places to entrap the villain.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Post-horses, ha, ha! [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>1st Noble.</i> My lord, we're something bold to know our duty.<br />
Your father's accidentally departed;<br />
The titles that were due to him meet you.<br />
<br />

I've many griefs to despatch out o' the way.<br />
Welcome, sweet titles!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i><br />
Talk to me, my lords,<br />
Of sepulchres and mighty emperors' bones;<br />
That's thought for me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> So one may see by this<br />
How foreign markets go;<br />
Courtiers have feet o' the nines, and tongues o' the twelves;<br />
They flatter dukes, and dukes flatter themselves. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
<br />
<i>2nd Noble.</i> My lord, it is your shine must comfort us.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Alas! I shine in tears, like the sun in April.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Noble.</i> You're now my lord's grace.<br />
<br />
<i>Lus.</i> My lord's grace! I perceive you'll have it so.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Lus.</i> Then, Heavens, give me grace to be so!<br />
<br />

<br />

Must run their circles into joys. No doubt but time<br />
Will make the murderer bring forth himself.<br />

Let us bethink the latest funeral honours<br />
Due to the duke's cold body. And withal,<br />

Griefs lift up joys: feasts put down funerals.<br />
<br />

The duchess is suspected foully bent;<br />
I'll begin dukedom with her banishment. [<i>Aside.</i><br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Lussurioso, Duchess</span>, <i>and</i> Nobles.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Spu.</i> Well, have at the fairest mark&mdash;so said the duke when he begot me;<br />
And if I miss his heart, or near about,<br />
Then have at any; a bastard scorns to be out. [<i>Exit.</i><br />

<p><i>Sup.</i> Notest thou that Spurio, brother?</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Yes, I note him to our shame.</p>

<p><i>Sup.</i> He shall not live: his hair shall not grow
much longer. In this time of revels, tricks may be
set afoot. Seest thou yon new moon? it shall outlive
the new duke by much; this hand shall dispossess
him. Then we're mighty.<br />
A mask is treason's licence, that build upon:<br />
'Tis murder's best face, when a vizard's on. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />

And do you think to be duke then, kind brother?<br />
I'll see fair play; drop one, and there lies t'other.<br />

<br />
<i>1st Lord.</i> Which way?<br />
<br />

We cannot justly be revenged too much.<br />
<br />

And those few nobles that have long suppressed you,<br />
Are busied to the furnishing of a masque,<br />
And do affect to make a pleasant tale on't:<br />
The masquing suits are fashioning: now comes in<br />
That which must glad us all. We too take pattern<br />
Of all those suits, the colour, trimming, fashion,<br />
E'en to an undistinguished hair almost:<br />
Then entering first, observing the true form,<br />
Within a strain or two we shall find leisure<br />
To steal our swords out handsomely;<br />
And when they think their pleasure sweet and good,<br />
In midst of all their joys they shall sigh blood.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Let that alone;<br />
By one and one their strengths shall be drunk down.<br />
<br />
<i>Hip.</i> There are five hundred gentlemen in the action,<br />
That will apply themselves, and not stand idle.<br />
<br />
<i>Piero.</i> O, let us hug your bosoms!<br />
<br />
<i>Ven.</i> Come, my lords,<br />
Prepare for deeds: let other times have words.<br />

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Readers of this volume who are anxious to obtain more light
upon Webster's art, must be referred to Lamb's notes in the
<i>Specimens from English Dramatic Poets</i>, to Mr. Swinburne's
article on John Webster in <i>The Nineteenth Century</i> for June, 1886,
and to my own essay upon <i>Vittoria Accoramboni</i> in <i>Italian
By-ways</i> (Smith and Elder, 1883).
</p>
<p>
The text adopted for Webster's two tragedies is that of
Dyce's edition. His arrangement of scenes has been followed,
except in the case of the <i>Vittoria Corombona</i>, which Dyce left
undivided. The notes, too, are in the main extracted from the
same source. With reference to Cyril Tourneur's plays, the text of
<i>The Atheist's Tragedy</i> has been modernised from Mr. Churton
Collins's edition; that of <i>The Revenger's Tragedy</i> is based upon
the modernised version in Hazlitt's edition of Dodsley, collated
throughout with Mr. Collins's text. Students of the English
drama owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Churton Collins for his
scholarly issue of the complete works of Tourneur.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
